<p>This program is used to create new phase equilibria diagrams or to
digitize images of existing ones. It can also be used for general
two-dimensional scientific drawing and digitization.</p>

<h2>File operations</h2>

<h3>New Diagram</h3>

<p>Create a new diagram from scratch. If you wish to digitize a
scanned image of an existing diagram, use the
<code><u>F</u>ile/<u>O</u>pen/<u>I</u>mage for Digitization</code>
option instead.</p>

<p>You are presented with a selection of diagram types. If you need to
use one of the ternary diagram types, you probably know it. Otherwise,
choose either the "Binary" diagram type to draw a rectangular graph
using a Cartesian coordinate system or the "Other/Schematic" type to
draw free-form diagrams starting with an empty page.</p>

<h3>Open diagram</h3>

<p>Open a diagram that was previously saved in this program's native
<code>PED</code> format. If the diagram was created using the "Open
Image for Digitization" option and the original image is still
available, then it will be loaded also.</p>

<a name="openimage"><h3>Open Image for Digitization</h3></a>

<p>Open an image file saved in GIF, JPEG, or PNG format in the Diagram
Selection Window. You will be given the opportunity to select the
boundary of a diagram within that file and then create a new diagram
traced from the old one. For more details, consult the Diagram
Selection Window's help menu option.</p>

<h3>Save / Save As PED</h3>

<p>Save a diagram in this program's native PED format.</p>

<h3>Save as PDF</h3>

<p>Save the diagram as an Adobe PDF document. This is an export-only
format; this program cannot read PDF files, even ones that it
created.</p>

<p>TODO Currently, strange characters get lost during save as PDF.</p>

<h3>Save as SVG</h3>

<p>TODO This doesn't work. Maybe one could get it to work, but that is
not a priority. (Maybe it should be, though, if the "save as PDF"
problems cannot be resolved.)</p>

<h3>Print</h3>

<p>Print the diagram to fit on a single sheet of paper (so a larger
piece of paper will yield a larger diagram).</p>

<h2><a name="positioning">Position</a></h2>

<p>You can position items within the diagram using just the mouse, but
there are also a number of alternative commands for diagram
positioning:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Move to ('p') or move to and select ('P') the nearest key
point. Key points include</p>

<ul>
  <li>vertices of curves</li>
  <li>label anchors</li>
  <li>corners of tie line regions</li>
  <li>endpoints of axes</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the following key points may be moved to, but cannot
be selected:</p>

<ul>
  <li>intersections of line segments with other segments or curves
  within the diagram (Currently curve+curve intersections are not
  detected.)</li>
  <li>corners of the diagram</li>
</ul>

<p>Often, several items will share the same precise position. Press
'P' repeatedly to cycle among those items until the correct item is
highlighted. This only works for items whose positions are truly
identical, and not for items whose positions differ by even a fraction
of a pixel.</p>
</li>

<li>Move to ('l', that is, a lower-case L) or move to and select ('L')
the closest line segment or curve.</li>

<li>Type ('t') the desired coordinates.</li>
</ul>

<p>The mouse will temporarily act as if stuck at the chosen point even
if vibration or a hand twich causes the mouse pointer to slip by a
pixel or two. When the mouse is "stuck", the pointer can still move,
but the coordinates displayed in the status bar do not change</p>

<p>You may unstick the mouse pointer by moving it a longer distance or
by pressing 'u'. In addition, the mouse may automatically become
unstuck if you request an operation that might otherwise be redundant,
such as adding a second vertex to a curve in a row.</p>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>The arrow keys move the mouse pointer in one pixel in any
direction. In addition, if an item is selected in green <b>and</b> the
mouse is positioned on that selection, then that item and every other
item located at the same position will be moved.</p>

<p>The following editing commands may be applied to any selected item.
An item must be selected (highlighted in <font
color="green">green</font>) before these commands have any effect.</p>

<ul>

<li>Press <code>Delete</code> to delete the selection.</li>

<li>Press 'c' to create a copy to the selection at the current mouse
position.</li>

<li>Press 'm' to move the selection point, including all other items
that share that point. Press capital 'M' to move only the item in
green while leaving all other items at that point unchanged.</li>

<li>Press 'e' to edit the selection. Items that support editing
include labels, tie lines, and rulers.</li>

<li>Pressing an arrow key moves the mouse position one pixel in the
corresponding direction. If the mouse is positioned at the selection,
then the selection and every other item that shares its position moves
with it.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Curves and Vertices</h2>

 Most vertices (control points) of the
currently selected curve are indicated by empty green circles, while
the currently selected point is indicated by a solid green circle.</p>

<h3>Starting a new curve</h3>

<p>To start a new curve, first deselect the current curve if one is
highlighted. Press the <code>End</code> key or choose main menu item
<code><u>C</u>urve/<u>D</u>eselect</code>) to do this. Then press the
left mouse button at the appropriate position to insert the first
endpoint of the new curve.</p>

<h3>Selecting an existing curve</h3>

<p>Move the mouse pointer over one of the vertices of that curve and
press '?'. If multiple curves pass through that vertex, then the first
curve selected might not be the one you want; continue pressing '?'
until the correct curve is highlighted in green.</p>

<h3>Deleting a vertex</h3>

<p>Select the vertex and then press the <code>Delete</code> key.</p>

<h3>Moving a vertex</h3>

<p>Move the selected vertex one pixel in any directions by using the
arrow keys.</p>

<p>You can move all vertices at a single position by selecting that
position with '?', positioning the mouse at the desired destination,
and pressing 'm'.</p>

<p>There is no specific 'move a vertex' operation, but once a vertex
is selected, it is straightfoward to delete it and then insert a new
vertex in its place.</p>

<h3>Adding to an existing curve</h3>

<p>To add a vertex to a curve, press the left mouse button. The new
vertex will be inserted after the previously selected vertex (so if
you want to add to the end of the curve, you will first have to select
the last vertex of that curve). The <font color="red">red</font>
outline, if any, displays the curve that will be result if you do
this.</p>

<p>To add a new vertex before (instead of after) the currently
selected point, select the menu item <code><u>C</u>urve/<u>S</u>elect
previous vertex</code> and then press the mouse button. This step is
necessary if you wish to add a point before the first vertex of the
curve.</p>

<h3>Curve smoothing and closure</h3>

<p>Press 's' to turn curve smoothing on or off for the currently selected
curve.</p>

<p>Press 'o' to close the currently selected curve the close or open
the currently selected curve. Closed curves loop back to their
starting points. There is no need to explicitly repeat the starting
vertex. Explicitly closing a smoothed curve usually gives better
results than just repeating the starting vertex does.</p>

<h3>Line styles</h3>

<p>Use the <code><u>C</u>urve/Line style</code> menu item and select
your preferred line style to change the style of the currently
selected item (if any) and the initial style of any subsequently added
items. The spacing of dots, dashes, and railroad ties is proportional
to the line width: if you reduce the width of a dashed line by half,
then the length of the dashes is also reduced by half.</p>

<h3>Line widths</h3>

<p>Use the <code><u>C</u>urve/Line width</code> menu item to change
the line width for the currently selected item (if any) and the
initial line width of any subsequently created items.</p>

<h3>Adding a cusp</h3>

<p>Press ',' to create a cusp (a location where a path is connected
but not smooth). This is just shorthand for adding a vertex at the
current mouse position and then starting a separate curve from the
same vertex.</p>

<h2>Decorations</h2>

<h3>Labels</h3>

<p>Press 't' to add text or a symbol anchored at the current mouse
position. A window will open, permitting you to choose the text, font
size, angle, and anchor orientation for the label.</p>

<p>Some HTML tags and Unicode notations are allowed. To avoid
confusion with HTML tags, less than signs ('&lt;') should be entered
as <code>&amp;lt;</code> (or press the '&lt;' key in the character
palette), and greater than signs ('&gt;') should be entered as
<code>&amp;gt;</code> (or press the '&gt;' key in the character
palette).</p>

<p>The standard font size has characters whose height equals about
0.16% of the height of binary diagrams, or 0.16% of the length of the
longest side of ternary diagrams. You may enter multiples of this base
font size as a fraction, percentage, or ordinary number.</p>

<p>Press capital 'T' to select the text whose center is closed to the
current mouse position. This may be more convenient than trying to
select the text by pressing 'P' at the mouse's anchor.</p>

<p>Press one of the nine anchor buttons when you are finished entering
the other fields (text and font size) for this label. The anchor
buttons determine whether the label will be centered at the anchor or
will have a corner or center of one side located there. The anchors
are relative to the text's frame of reference. For example, for a
label whose text reads "Label", the portion of the text closest to the
anchor will be the portion that is closest to the green circle on the
button, regardless of the text angle.</p>

<p>The circle with the green arrow is just an illustration of angle
values, not a usable control. Edit the number in the text box to
change the text angle.</p>

<p>Press <code>e</code> to edit the currently selected label, if there
is one, or to select and edit the label whose center is closest to the
current mouse position.</p>

<h3>Symbols</h3>

<h4>Dots</h4>

<p>A dot is just a curve with only one vertex, so the rules for
creating dots are covered by the rules for creating curves. You may
use the 'd' key as a short-cut to create a dot at the current mouse
position. To change the dot size, adjust the line width: the dot
radius equals twice the line width.</p>

<h4>Arrowheads</h4>

<p>To draw an arrowhead that points at the angle indicated in the
"Tangent" window, press '&gt;'. To draw an arrowhead that points in
the opposite direction, press '&lt;'. The size of the arrowhead is a
fixed multiple of the line width indicated in the "Tangent"
window.</p>

<h2>View Menu</h2>

<p>Press '-' to zoom out, '+' to zoom in, and <code>Control-B</code>
to obtain the best fit of the diagram to the edit window's current
size.</p>

<p>Resizing the scanned image or moving around an image at a high zoom
level may take some time, so be patient. You may turn off display of the
background image with <code><u>V</u>iew/<u>B</u>ackground
Image/<u>N</u>one</code> to eliminate this delay.</p>

<p>Use the <code>Background Image</code> submenu to select how to
display the original image (if any) in the background of the new
diagram: in light, faded colors (the default); blinking on and off; or not at all.</p>
