<h2>Creating or adding points to curves</h2>

<p>If a curve is currently selected, then that curve appears in <font
color="green">green</font>, and the currently selected vertex is
marked with a solid green circle. Other vertices of the currently
selected curve are marked with empty green circles.</p>

<p>To edit an existing curve that is not already selected, move the
mouse pointer over one of the vertices of that curve and press '?'. If
multiple curves pass through that vertex, then the first curve
selected might not be the one you want; continue pressing '?' until
the curve highlighted in green is the correct one.</p>

<p>Any new vertices will be added immediately after the currently
selected vertex. To add the point immediately before the currently
selected vertex instead, select the menu item
<code><u>C</u>urve/<u>R</u>everse vertex order</code>. To start a new
curve instead, press the <code>End</code> key, or equivalently choose
main menu item <code><u>C</u>urve/<u>D</u>eselect</code>).</p>

<p>If no curve is currently selected, then adding a new vertex will
start a new curve. As a special case, a curve that has only one vertex
is displayed as a small black dot whose size is a fixed multiple of
the current line width.</p>

<p>To add a vertex, press the left mouse button. If a curve is
currently selected, the <font color="red">red</font> outline displays
the curve that will be result if you do this.</p>

<p>Previously inserted vertices, corners of the diagram, and
intersections of curves that have been added to the diagram are key
points. Press the period ('.') key to move the mouse to the closest
key point, then press the left mouse button to add this point to the
curve.</p>

<p>Pressing the period key causes the mouse to be temporarily treated
by some operations as if it were stuck at the key point. This protects
you from losing your place become of a slight twitch of the mouse. If
necessary, you may move the mouse an inch or so to unstick it.</p>

<p>Type an underscore ('_') to make the mouse move to and become stuck
at the nearest point (key or not) on any curve or edge of the diagram.
Press the left mouse button to add this point to the curve.</p>

<p>Press ',' to create a cusp (a first-derivative discontinuity). This
is exactly the same as adding the current mouse position, deselecting
the curve, and then starting a new curve also at the current mouse
position.</p>

<p>To turn curve smoothing on or off, press 's'. This change affects
the currently selected curve (if any) and any new curves you create
(until you press 's' again).</p>

</p>

<h3>Dots</h3>

<p>A dot is just a curve with only one vertex, so the rules for
creating dots are covered by the rules for creating curves. You may
use the 'd' key as a short-cut to create a dot at the current mouse
position. To change the dot size, adjust the line width: the dot
radius equals twice the line width.</p>

<h3>Arrowheads</h3>

<p>To draw an arrowhead that points at the angle indicated in the
"Tangent" window at the current location (as selected using the '.',
'_', or '?' keys, or at the current mouse position otherwise), press
'&gt;'. To draw an arrowhead that points in the opposite direction,
press '&lt;'. The size of the arrowhead is a fixed multiple of the
line width indicated in the "Tangent" window.</p>

<p>To delete an arrowhead, right-click next to it and select the
<code><u>D</u>ecorations/<u>D</u>elete nearest symbol</code> menu
item.</p>
