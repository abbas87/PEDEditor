<h1>PED Edit Window Help</h1>

<p>This program creates new phase equilibria diagrams and digitizes
images of existing ones. It can also be used for general
two-dimensional scientific drawing and digitization.</p>

<h2>File Menu</h2>

<h3>New Diagram</h3>

<p>Create a new diagram from scratch. If you wish to digitize a
scanned image of an existing diagram, use the
<a href="#open"><code>File/Open</code></a> option instead.</p>

<p>You are presented with a selection of diagram types. Select the
"Binary" diagram type to draw a rectangular graph using a Cartesian
coordinate system. Select the "Schematic/Other" type to draw free-form
diagrams starting from a blank page. There are also various subtypes
of ternary diagram, if you happen to need those.</p>

<h3><a id="open">Open</a></h3>

<p>Open either an image file saved in GIF, JPEG, or PNG format or a
diagram that was previously saved in this program's native
<code>PED</code> format.</p>

<p>If you open an image file, a window will open that allows you to
select the boundary of a diagram within that image and then create a
new diagram traced from the old one. That window has its own Help menu
option which provides more information.</p>

<h3>Save / Save As PED</h3>

<p>Save a diagram as a file in this program's native PED format. This
is the only choice that allows you to reload the diagram later in this
program and continue where you left off.</p>

<h3>Save as PDF</h3>

<h3>Save as PNG</h3>

<h3>Save as SVG</h3>

<p>Save an image of the diagram. These formats are only intended to
create files that other programs can read; they are not useful for
saving and reloading diagrams in the PED editor. Diagrams saved as PDF
or SVG tend to be of higher quality than diagrams saved as PNG.

<h3>Print</h3>

<p>Print the diagram. The image will be scaled so that its margins
just fit on the sheet. You can make the printed image appear smaller
or larger by adjusting the margins as defined
under <u>P</u>roperties/<u>M</u>argins.

<h3>Reload</h3>

<p>Reload the current diagram from disk if the diagram was
previously opened or saved in PED format.

<h2>Position Menu</h2>

<p>In addition to moving the mouse pointer, the following commands are
available for diagram positioning:</p>

<ul>

<li><p><b>Jump to selection</b> (<code>j</code>) moves the mouse
pointer to the currently selected item, if an item is
selected.</p></li>

<li>

<b>Select nearest point</b> (<code>Shift+Q</code>) moves the mouse to
and selects the nearest key point. Key points include

<ul>
  <li>arrows</li>
  <li>vertexes of curves</li>
  <li>label anchor points and centers</li>
  <li>corners of tie line regions</li>
  <li>ruler endpoints</li>
</ul>

<p>If pressing <code>Shift+Q</code> once does not highlight the item you
want, you may press it again and again to highlight other items
located nearby.</p>

<li>

<p><b>Nearest point</b> (<code>q</code>) moves the mouse to the
nearest key point, but does not select it. <code>Nearest point</code>
recognizes the following key points, in addition to those recognized
by <code>Select nearest point</code>:

<ul>
  <li>curve and line intersections
  <li>corners of the diagram
  <li>segment midpoints
  <li>If an item is selected, then the point on the curve nearest the
    mouse that is nearest to the selection point is also considered to
    be a key point. (In other words, first identify the curve closest
    to the mouse. The point on that curve that is closest to the
    selection point is a key point.)
</ul>

</li>

<li><b>Select nearest line/curve</b> (<code>Shift+W</code>) moves the
mouse to the the nearest point on any ruler or curve and selects the
nearest vertex on that ruler or curve.

<li><b>Nearest line/curve</b> (<code>w</code>) moves the mouse to the
the nearest point on any ruler or curve.

<li><b>Enter coordinates</b> (<code>Enter</code>) allows you to type
in the coordinates you would like the mouse to move to. If you enter
coordinates that are off the diagram page, the page will be enlarged
to put the position on its edge.</li>

<li>The arrow keys move the mouse pointer in one pixel in any
direction. In addition, if the mouse is positioned on a selected item
(highlighted in green unless the item was green to begin with, in
which case it is highlighted in magenta), then that item and every
other item located at the same position will move along with the mouse
pointer.</li>

<li><p>Auto-position the mouse (<code>Shift+A</code>) or auto-position
the mouse and add a point at the mouse's new location
(<code>Shift+Left-Click</code> or <code>Shift+X</code>).</p>

<p>Holding the shift key down while moving the mouse will reveal the
auto-position location. All of the following are candidates for
auto-positioning:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Key points</b>: Key points are highlighted in yellow.</li>

<li><b>Curves and rulers</b>: If no key point is nearby but a curve or
ruler is, then the nearest point on it is selected in orange.</li>

<li><p><b>Vertical and horizontal lines</b>: If an item is selected,
then for purposes of identifying key points and curves, the program
behaves as if the diagram contains invisible horizontal and vertical
lines through the selection point, if any.

<li><p>The program may also include invisible lines through the
selection at <b>other special angles</b>. These angles include the
value indicated in the "Slope" window, lines in ternary diagrams at 60
or 120 degrees, and lines of zero change for user-defined variables
created using
<a href="#variable"><code>Properties/Variables/Add</code></a>.</p>

<p>To create a rectangle using these features:</p>

<ol>

<li>If necessary, disable smoothing by unselecting
  the <code>Curve/Smooth through new points</code> check box. Also, if
  a curve is already selected, press <code>Escape</code> to unselect
  it.

<li>Add the bottom left corner of the rectangle using one of the
  procedures described for "Starting a new curve" in the <code>Curve
  Menu</code> section of this document.

<li>Move the mouse near the intended bottom right corner and
press <code>Shift+left mouse button</code>.

<li>Move the mouse near the intended upper right corner and
  press <code>Shift+left mouse button</code>.

<li>Press <code>o</code> to make a closed polygon.

<li>Move the mouse near the intended upper left corner and
  press <code>Shift+left mouse button</code>.

</ol>

<p>To create a line segment parallel to an existing line segment:</p>

<ol>

<li>Add the first vertex of the line using one of the procedures
already described. Let the new vertex remain selected.

<li>Press <code>w</code> to select the line you want the new line to
  be parallel to. This will enter the slope of that line in the Slope
  window so auto-position will prefer points at the given slope with
  respect to your first vertex.

<li>Move the mouse near the other intended endpoint and
  press <code>Shift+left mouse button</code>.

</ol>

<p>The secondary selection only applies when a ruler or curve with two
or more vertexes is selected, and is always a vertex adjacent to the
selected vertex.
</ul>

<p>Sometimes the auto-positioning is attracted by a key point that
prevents you from clicking on a curve or grid line instead. You may
sidestep this problem by pressing using '+' to zoom in until the screen
distance to the key point becomes large enough that it no longer
attracts the mouse pointer.</p>

<p>To protect users against involuntary mouse movements, the cursor
stays at the chosen position after you perform a mouse positioning
command even if the mouse shifts by a couple pixels. The chosen
position will be marked with a yellow cross if that position is
different from the mouse position. Moving the mouse a larger distance
or pressing <code>u</code> will cause the cursor to resume following
the mouse pointer. In addition, the mouse may automatically become
unstuck before you perform an operation that would otherwise be
redundant, such as adding the same vertex to a curve twice in a row.

</ul>

<h2>Edit Selection Menu</h2>

<p>These commands all operate on the selection (highlighted
in <span style="color:green;">green</span>) if there is one. If
nothing is selected, then some of these commands generate an error,
while others will affect the nearest key point.

<ul>

<li>Press <code>Delete</code> to delete the selection.</li>

<li>Select the <code>Delete All</code> option to delete the entire
selected curve (instead of a single point) or to delete all labels
whose text matches the selected label.</li>

<li>Press <code>Escape</code> or the right mouse button to deselect
the item.</li>

<li>Press <code>r</code> to change the selection's color. If the
selection is highlighted in green, you may not notice the color change
until you deselect the item.</li>

<li>Press <code>c</code> to create a copy to the selection at the
current mouse position.</li>

<li>Press <code>e</code> to edit the selected item's properties. Only
labels, rulers, and sets of tie lines may be edited this way.

<li><p>Press <code>v</code> to move the selected vertex or item and all
other items at the same location to the current mouse position.

<p>Special note for labels which are not anchored in the center: when
moving labels, it matters whether you selected the label's center (the
green circle is empty) or its anchor (the green circle is solid). If
you select a label by its center, then the center, not the anchor,
will move to the current mouse position.

<li>Press <code>Shift+V</code> to move the selected vertex or item
only.

<li>Press <code>Shift+R</code> to move the selected curve or ruler and
all selectable key points that lie on or in that curve or ruler.

<li>Press <code>d</code> to change the selected item's color, line
thickness (if applicable), and line style (if applicable) to the
current default values.

<li>Press <code>Shift+D</code> to change the current default values
for color, line thickness (if applicable), and line style (if
applicable) to match the selected item. So
pressing <code>Shift+D</code> on one item and then
pressing <code>d</code> on others is a quick way to change many things
to match the first thing.

</ul>

<h2>Curve Menu</h2>

<p>Position the mouse where the new vertex goes and
press <code>x</code> or the left mouse button. To add a point at the
auto-position location instead, press <code>Shift+X</code>
or <code>Shift+left mouse button</code>.

<p>If a vertex (curve control point) is currently selected, then it is
marked by a small solid green circle. Other control points on the same
curve are indicated by small open green circles.</p>

<h3>Starting a new curve</h3>

<p>If a curve is already selected, press <code>Escape</code> or the right
mouse button to deselect it.

<p>Position the mouse where the first vertex of the new curve belongs
and press <code>x</code> or the left mouse button. To start a new
curve at the auto-position location instead, hold down the shift key
as you press <code>x</code> or the left mouse button.

<p>A curve consisting of a single point is represented as a dot twice
as wide as the current line width. It may be tempting to mark data
points this way, but for various reasons, it usually works better to
mark data points using 1-character labels.

<h3>Adding a point to a curve</h3>

<p>As described in the <code>Position Menu</code> section, you may
press <code>Shift+W</code> or <code>Shift+Q</code> to select a place
on the curve to add a new vertex.

<p>For curves, of at least two points, the program not only has a
selected vertex but a selected side where new points will be added.
The red line that follows the mouse should provide a hint which side
of the vertex is selected; if the red line is twisted, then you
probably want to move to the other side. You can shift the selected
vertex and the selected side of that vertex using <code>Select left
vertex</code> (<code>[</code>) or <code>Select right vertex</code>
(<code>]</code>).

<ul>

<li><p>Select or unselect the <b>Smooth through new points</b> check
box to turn on or off curve smoothing through each subsequently added
vertex. You can also press <code>s</code> to toggle this setting.
Existing vertexes are not affected.

<p>Unsmoothed curves of three or more points are presented as a series
of connected line segments or (for closed curves) a polygon.

<li><p><b>Toggle closure</b> (<code>o</code>) will change an open
curve to a closed one or vice versa. All curves start in the open
state. Closed curves have an extra segment looping back from the last
vertex to the first. If that segment does not appear to be smoothed
properly, you may need to go back and select <code>Toggle point
smoothing</code> for one or both of the curve's endpoints.

<li><p><b>Toggle point smoothing</b> (<code>,</code>) changes the
smoothing setting for the selected vertex. To change the smoothing
setting for a whole curve, toggle point smoothing for each vertex
individually.

<li><p><b>Line style</b> changes the line style for the currently
selected item, if any, and the initial style of any subsequently added
items. The spacing of dots and dashes is proportional to the line
width: if you reduce the width of a dashed line by half, then the
length of the dashes is also reduced by half.</p>

<li><p><b>Line width</b> changes the line width for the currently
selected item (if any) and the initial line width of any subsequently
created items.</p>

<li><p><b>Fill style</b> fills the interior of a closed curve with the
chosen pattern in the current default color. You must close the curve
using <code>o</code> before you can fill it. See
also <code><u>E</u>dit Selection/<u>L</u>ayer</code> to insure the
fill pattern only obscures the right decorations.

<li><p><b>Select left vertex</b> (<code>[</code>) and <b>Select right
vertex</b> (<code>]</code>) shift the selection one vertex
backward or forward depending on the curve's direction at the current
selection.

</ul>

<h2>Decoration Menu</h2>

<h3>Labels</h3>

<p>Press <code>t</code> to add text or a symbol anchored at the
current mouse position. A window will open, permitting you to choose
the text, font size, angle, and anchor orientation for the label.</p>

<p>The standard font size has characters whose height is about 2% of
the height of binary diagrams and 2% of the length of the longest side
of ternary diagrams. </p>

<p>Use the <code>H2SO4-&gt;H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></code> button
to automatically add subscripts to chemical formulas.</p>

<p>The circle with the green arrow illustrates angle values but is not
a usable control. Edit the number in the text box to change the text
angle.</p>

<p>The nine anchor buttons determine whether the label will be
centered at the anchor or will have a corner or center of one side
located there. The anchors use the text's frame of reference: for
example, if the label reads "Foo" and the lower right button is
selected, then the corner of the F will lie closest to the anchor, no
matter what text angle is selected.

<p>If you check the box for <b>White label background</b>, a white
rectangle will be printed behind the label. White label background only
obscures decorations beneath the label, so you may need to use
the <code><u>E</u>dit/<u>L</u>ayer/<u>t</u>o Top</code> command as
well.

<p>If you check the box for <b>White character holes</b>, the insides
of hollow letters and characters will be painted white. This option is
mostly useful for symbols, and it insures that a hollow circle plotted
over a solid line is not mistaken for a solid circle. White character
holes only obscure decorations beneath the label, so you may need to
use the <code><u>E</u>dit/<u>L</u>ayer/<u>t</u>o Top</code> command as
well.

<p>If you check the box for <b>Label border</b>, the label will be surrounded
by a thin border.

<p>The copy command ('c') can be used to easily duplicate a symbol in
many locations, such as when marking data points.</p>


<h3>Arrowheads</h3>

<p>To draw an arrowhead that points at the angle indicated in the
"Slope" window, press '&gt;'. To draw an arrowhead that points in
the opposite direction, press '&lt;'. The size of the arrowhead is
determined by the line width indicated in the "Slope" window.</p>

<h3>Rulers</h3>

<p>To create a ruler, first create a two-vertex line to mark the
ruler's endpoints, then select <code><u>D</u>ecorations/Add
r<u>u</u>ler</code>. A ruler edit window will open.</p>

<p>There is currently no way to automatically generate a ruler that
displays weight percent values in a mole-percent diagram or vice
versa. All you can do is convert the entire diagram between the two
states.</p>

<p>Rulers display variable/component values. Instead of telling the
system that you want the ruler to go from 0 to 1, you tell which
variable you want to display. If there isn't one that goes from 0 to 1
in the range you want, you can create a new variable
using <a href="#variable"><code>Properties/Variables/Add</code></a>.

<p><b>Tick labels</b>: Controls whether to show numbers next to big
tick locations. (Small ticks are never labeled.) If you are facing in
the direction of a vector from the first end of the ruler to the
second, tick labels on the left side mean that the labels will be on
the left side of that vector. If you don't remember or know which end
of the ruler was first, then pick a side arbitrarily and switch if it
turns out to be the wrong one. one, and if that doesn't work, try the
other one.

<p><b>Label angle with respect to axis</b>: A zero degree angle means
that the labels are parallel to the ruler axis (which does not mean
that the label text is horizontal unless the ruler itself is
horizontal). Positive angles are clockwise with respect to that.

<p>By default, the program will assign reasonable tick values and tick
distances, but you can tweak these values in a number of ways.

<p>When drawing two rulers that cross in the middle, such as for a
Cartesian graph that displays four quadrants for the negative and
positive X and Y values, there may be difficulties where the rulers
cross (typically at the origin). The X-axis label at x=0 will
typically be overstruck by the Y-axis, and the Y-axis label at y=0
will typically be overstruck by the X-axis. A solution to that is to
replace each individual ruler with two separate ones that lie along
the same line and meet at the origin, and to check the boxes to
suppress the rulers' start or end ticks and labels.

<p><b>Minimum white space between tick labels, in multiples of label
height</b>: If you do not explicitly tell the ruler where to put the
ticks, the program tries to figure out on its own how close together
the ticks can be without causing the labels to crowd each other. (That
applies even if the labels are turned off.) You can increase the
minimum separation between labels by entering larger values here. This
is only a minimum value, and the actual tick step will be a round
number large enough to exceed this minimum, which means that depending
on specifics, a slight change to this value may not affect the actual
tick step. Generally speaking, a value of 0 means that labels will be
fairly close together, while a value of 3 means that the labels are
more widely spaced.

<p><b>Big tick step size (optional)</b>: You may specify what the
difference between big ticks should be or leave this blank to allow
the program to choose a reasonable value. On its own, the program will
always choose values that are 1, 2, or 5 times a power of 10.

<p><b>Small tick step size (optional)</b>: You may specify what the
difference between big ticks should be or leave this blank to allow
the program to choose a reasonable value (normally the next round
number less than the big tick step size).

<p><b>Minimum/maximum tick value (optional)</b>: Usually you want the
ticks to extend the length of the ruler, possibly leaving out the
start or endpoints. In that case, leave this blank. But if you want to
explicitly specify the minimum and maximum tick values, you may do so
here.

<p><b>Left/right-side tick marks</b>: Check or uncheck to remove the
tick marks on the left and right side of the axis. As elsewhere, if
you don't know which side is left and which is right, use trial and
error.

<p><b>V-shaped tick marks</b> are used mainly for ternary diagrams.
Check this box if you need them.

<p><b>Use percentages in labels</b>: If you check this, the labels
will display values that are 100 times greater than the underlying
variable. As mentioned in the <code>Chemistry Menu</code> section, if
you are showing percentage values, then you should insure this box is
checked; and if the values you get look right even when the box is not
checked, you should probably decrease the underlying variable by a
factor of 100, especially if you hope to use any of the chemistry
functions.

<p><b>Start/End arrow</b>: Check this box to add an arrow at the
ends of the axis.

<p><b>Suppress start/end tick</b>: Check this box to suppress any tick
marks that might otherwise appear at the start/end of the ruler. to be
there.

<p><b>Suppress start/end label</b>: Check this box to suppress any label
that might otherwise appear at the start or end of the ruler.

<p><b>Suppress small ticks:</b> Check this to prevent all small tick
marks from being displayed.

<h3>Tie Lines</h3>

<p>To create a set of tie lines, select <code>Decorations/Add
tie lines</code> and follow the instructions in the window that
opens. </p>

<p>If tie lines connect two segments or curves, instead of connecting
a curve to a point, then the two outermost tie lines had better
intersect somewhere outside the region created by the tie lines, or
else there will be trouble. It's hard to explain. That's another TODO
item.</p>

<h2>Properties Menu</h2>

<ul>

<li><b>Aspect Ratio</b>: change the ratio of the diagram's width to
its height by uniformly rescaling its horizontal dimension. This may
cause existing curve intersections to shift (so lines that used to
intersect may not quite do so anymore, or they may intersect at a
slightly different location), so it is best to set the aspect ratio as
early as possible.</li>

<li><p><b>Font</b>: The program uses variants of the DejaVu LGC Serif and
Sans Serif font families. <code>Serif (widely spaced lines)</code>
exists for backwards compatibility; it is not recommended for use in
new diagrams.</p>

<p>This menu selection allows you to globally change the font
selection among one of three choices. Changing fonts for individual
items is not currently possible.

<li><b>Key/Value Pairs</b>: Allows the user to store data that
consists of a string key and a string value. A value of
the empty string is taken to mean "delete this key", so the empty string
cannot be stored as a value.</li>

<li><b>Margins</b>: If you need to align your diagram in a specific
way, or if you need to extend a diagram in any direction, you may set
the left, right, top, and bottom margins using these menu options. The
<code><u>A</u>uto-fit</code> option eliminates excess white space on
all sides. It is a good idea to allow generous margins while you are
editing the diagram, and then select <code><u>A</u>uto-fit</code> when
finished.</li>

<li><b>Scale</b>: This option allows you to change the units of the X
and Y axis, while the positions of items on the screen remains the
same. This option is most often used to change the axes' initial
ranges to the values you really want, but it can also be used to
change a diagram's range from Celsius to Kelvin, for example.</li>

<li><b>Tags</b>: Allow the user to store free-form string data. Apart
from permitting the user to add, delete, and display tags, the program
does nothing with these.</li>

<li><b>Title</b>: Change the title of the diagram as displayed in the
menu bar and in printouts. If you want no title, then change the title
to the empty string so it will be deleted.</li>

<li><b><a id="variable">Variables</a></b>: You can delete existing variables or add new
ones that are affine transformations of the existing ones; that is,
variables that have the form

  <blockquote><code>a x + b y + c</code></blockquote>

<p>New variables will be shown in the gray status bar at the bottom of
the edit window and may be used to define ruler tick mark values.
Select this menu item and then follow the instructions in the error
message to learn how to do this.

</ul>

<h2>Digitize Menu</h2>

<ul>

<p>Files saved during export use the UTF-8 character encoding.</p>

<p>If you need to export data in ways that are more advanced than
these menu items allow, you could work directly from the PED files,
which are in human-readable JSON format. The PED file format does not
have a formal specification and is subject to change, but just by
looking at some PED files you can get some idea what is involved.</p>

<li><p><b>Export all text</b>: Export all labels, key values, tags,
and diagram components, with duplicates removed. Each entry is
terminated by a newline.

<li><p><b>Export selected curve or label's coordinates</b>: If a curve
is highlighted, then the coordinates of every control point for that
curve will be exported, one coordinate per line, with the x and y
values separated by commas. If a label (usually a symbol that denotes
a data point) is highlighted, then the coordinates of that label and
every other label that shares the same text will be copied. For
instance, if you have highlighted an open circle, then the coordinates
of every open circle will be copied.

<li><p><b>Export all curve and label coordinates</b>: Export the
coordinates of all curve control points and all labels. Coordinates
belonging to a single curve and labels that share the same text are
grouped together; groups are separated from each other by comment
lines that start with a sharp sign (#).

<p>Checking the <code>Add comments</code> box will make the output
easier to read but may make it harder to import the data into other
programs.

<li><p><b>Import curve or label coordinates</b>: This is the inverse
of the two former operations. If a curve is highlighted, then points
will be added to it. If a label is highlighted, then similar labels
will be added. If nothing is highlighted, one or more new curves will
be created, with empty lines or lines that contain only a comment
(beginning with the sharp sign #) marking the beginning of a new
curve.

<p>Sometimes it can help to export and then immediately reimport data.
For instance, if you have marked a set of data points using labels
containing identical symbols, then you can select one of those
symbols, choose <code>Export selected curve or label's
coordinates</code>, press Escape to deselect them, then
choose <code>Import label or curve coordinates</code> to create a
curve between those points.

<li><p><b>Copy status bar</b> (<code>Control+Shift+S</code>): This
copies the text in the gray status bar at the bottom of the edit
window to the clipboard. Since the contents depend on the current
mouse position, you will probably need to use the keyboard shortcut to
do this.

</ul>

<h2>Chemistry Menu</h2>

<ul>

<li><p><b>Components</b>: Identify the diagram components for binary and
ternary diagrams. Binary diagrams whose X-axis is measured on a scale
from (100% of substance A, 0% of B) have a left and right diagram
component, while ternary diagrams have a left, right, and top
component. In this context, the diagram components are the compounds
that correspond to 0 and 100% of your independent variables, even if
the displayed domain is a subset of that.

<p>The program's chemistry functions cannot work unless you define the
formulas for both (or all, in the case of ternary diagrams) diagram
components, and the formulas must be entered using the following
syntax in order for the program to parse them correctly:

<p><b><i><a id="chemical_syntax">Chemical formula syntax</a></i>:
the program's chemistry functions cannot work unless you define the
formulas for both (or all, in the case of ternary diagrams) diagram
components. Currently, <code>[Co(H2O)2]1.5</code> is as complicated a
formula as the program can understand; that is, the program
understands element symbols, grouping with brackets or parentheses,
and integer and fixed-point subscripts that follow either element
symbols or groupings, but that is it. None of the following examples
would work as intended:

<ul>

<li>"<code>water</code>" (not a chemical formula)

<li>"<code>2 H2O</code>" (leading '2' is not understood)

<li>"<code>H2O + Al</code>" (misintepreted as "<code>H2O</code>"
because the program stops reading after the space, and it does not
understand plus signs anyway)

</ul>

 -- leading numbers (2 H2O) and plus signs
are not currently allowed, and anything after an embedded space is
ignored.

; <code>water</code> is not. The rules are strict and
somewhat limited -- basically anything 


<p>As soon as all diagram components are defined, the gray status bar
will show additional information about points on the screen. If a
position in the diagram corresponds precisely to a round formula, that
formula will be shown; otherwise, a decimal estimation of the formula
will be shown. Also, component values will be shown as a
pair <code>mole percent/weight percent</code>.

<p>The status bar is more useful if you enter coordinates precisely. A
coordinate value of 1/3 Fe, 2/3 Al will be displayed as Al2Fe, but an
approximate coordinate value of 33.3% Fe, 66.7% Al will not. Also,
only if the coordinates in the diagram you create are precisely
correct, users of the program can use <code>Shift+left mouse
button</code> or <code>q</code> to find the exact chemical formula at
any vertex or intersection.

<p>Also pay attention to your percent symbols and to the <code>Use
percentages in labels</code> check box that appears in the "Edit
Ruler" dialog. If you wish to show percentage values (that is, values
that are 100 times greater than the proportion values) in a ruler,
that box should be checked. Check the status bar: a vaolue of 77%
should be displayed as either 0.77 or as 77%. A display value of "77"
or "7700%" indicates the variable scale is wrong.

<li><p><b>Proportions/Already displaying mole fraction</b>: The
program doesn't know whether your input data are in mole percent or
weight percent until you tell it. If the first element of the supposed
mole percent/weight percent pair is actually showing the weight
percent, then you need to check this box. If the second element of the
pair is actually showing the mole percent, then you need to un-check
this box.

<li><p><b>Proportions/Convert to [weight/mole] fraction</b>: Only one
of these operations will be enabled, because you cannot convert a
diagram to display weight fraction, for example, if it already
displays weight fraction. These operations transform the entire
diagram between weight and mole fraction values.

<p>There is no guarantee that every point on every curve of the
diagram will be correct after you perform a conversion, and points
outside the diagram may not line up very well at all. The diagram may
look funny, especially if there is a wide divergence between the mole
and weight percents.

<li><p><b>Formula to mole/weight fraction</b> (also available by
pressing the <code>%</code> key, that is (on US
keyboards) <code>Shift+5</code>): Enter a chemical formula, and the
mouse will move to the position in the diagram that that formula
corresponds to. The next step may be to press 't' to put a label at
that location and maybe (for Windows) press <code>Control-V</code> to
label that location with the formula.

<li><p><b>Copy all formulas to clipboard</b>: Copy all unique formulas
in the diagram to the clipboard in alphabetical order, separated by
newlines. For example, if there is a label that reads "I saw H2O", then the
formula list will include "H2O" and "I", since I is the chemical formula for iodine.

</ul>

<h2>View Menu</h2>

<p>Press the left button and drag the mouse to zoom in.
Press <code>Control+B</code> (best fit) to exactly fill the edit
window with the diagram.

<p>Alternatively, you can press '-' to zoom out and '+' to zoom in.

<p><b>Center mouse</b> (<code>Control+L</code>) brings the part of the
diagram under the mouse towards the center of the edit window. (The
mouse may not end up in the center if that would require moving the
edge of the diagram inside the edit window.)

<p>Use the <b>View/Background Image</b> submenu to select how to
display the original image (if any) in the background of the new
diagram. <code>Control+H</b> changes the original image from visible
to hidden and vice versa. <b>View/Background Image/Detach</b>
permanently removes the linkage from the new diagram to the original
image; the background image disappears and the Zoom window closes.

<p><b>Zoom to selection</b> (<code>Control+Z</code>) causes the
currently selected item, if any, to fill the edit window.
