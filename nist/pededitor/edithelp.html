<h1>PED Edit Window Help</h1>

<p><i>Please note that this file will open using the default browser
you have chosen for your computer, either full- or partial-screen,

<p>The PED (Phase Equilibria Diagram) Editor was written by Eric
Boesch to digitize phase diagrams for the PED Data Center. The editor
can also be used for general scientifc drawing and two-dimensional
visualization. The latest version is available for downloading as
freeware with some restrictions;
see <a href="http://www.nist.gov/srd/nist31.cfm">http://www.nist.gov/srd/nist31.cfm</a>.

<p>Some features may be accessed through the menu bar along the top
edge of the Viewer screen, while others are accessed through a menu
that is raised by pressing the right mouse button (if your mouse does
not have a right button, use whatever control you normally use to
raise popup menus). These functions (and their keyboard shortcuts) are
described below.

<h3>New Diagram</h3>

<p>Create a new diagram from scratch. If you wish to digitize a
scanned image of an existing diagram, use the
<a href="#open"><code>File/Open</code></a> option instead.</p>

<p>You are presented with a selection of diagram types. Select the
"Binary or Cartesian" type for Cartesian graphs, binary diagrams,
quaternary diagrams, and all other diagrams based on a rectangular
graph. For ternary diagrams, select one of the "Ternary" subtypes. If
none of the given categories apply, select the "Free-form" type to
start with a blank page.

<h3><a id="open">Open</a></h3>

<p>Open either an image file saved in GIF, JPEG, or PNG format or a
diagram that was previously saved in this program's native PED
format.</p>

<p>If you open an image file, a window will open that allows you to
select the boundary of a diagram within that image and then create a
new diagram traced from the old one. That window has its own Help menu
option which provides more information.</p>

<h3>Save / Save As PED</h3>

<p>Save a diagram as a file in this program's native PED format. This
is the only choice that allows you to reload the diagram later with
this program and continue where you left off.</p>

<h3>Save as PDF</h3>

<h3>Save as PNG</h3>

<p>Save an image of the diagram. Diagrams saved as PDF stay sharp at
higher magnification, but diagrams saved as PNG do not.

<h3>Print</h3>

<p>Print the diagram. The image will be scaled so that its margins
just fit on the sheet. You can make the printed image appear smaller
or larger by <a href="#Margins">adjusting the margins</a>.

<h3>Next File</h3>

<p>Switch to the next selected diagram, if any. This option is only
enabled if you opened multiple files at once.

<h3>Refresh</h3>

<p>Refresh the current diagram from disk if the diagram was previously
opened or saved in PED format.

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<h2><a id="Position">Position</a></h2>

<p>This menu includes functions to move the mouse pointer within the diagram.

<h3 id=Autoposition>Auto-positioning</h3>

<p>Holding the shift key down while moving the mouse causes the mouse
to be attracted to nearby curves and points of special interest,
including

<ul>

<li><a href="#NearestPoint">Key points</a> are highlighted in olive.

<li><b>Curves and rulers</b>: If no key point is close, the nearest
point on a curve or ruler may be highlighted in orange.

<li><p><b>Vertical and horizontal lines</b>: If an item is selected,
then for purposes of identifying key points and curves, the program
behaves as if the diagram contains invisible horizontal and vertical
lines through the selection point, if any.

<li><p>The program may also include invisible lines through the
selection at <b>other special angles</b>. These angles include the
value indicated in <a href=#SlopeWindow>the "Slope" window</a>, lines
in ternary diagrams at 60 or 120 degrees, and lines of zero change for
user-defined variables created using
<a href="#Variable"><code>Properties/Variables/Add</code></a>.
</ul>

<p>Sometimes the auto-positioning is attracted by a key point that
prevents you from clicking on a curve or grid line instead. You may
sidestep this problem by <a href="#DragToZoom">zooming in</a> until
the screen distance becomes large enough that the key point no longer
attracts the mouse pointer.</p>

<ul>

<li><b><a id="Enter">Enter coordinates</a></b> (<code>Enter</code>) allows you to type
in the coordinates you would like the mouse to move to. If you enter
coordinates that are off the diagram page, the page will be enlarged
to put the position on its edge.

<li><p><b>Jump to selection</b> (<code>j</code>) moves the mouse
pointer to the currently selected item, if an item is
selected.</p></li>

<li><p>To protect users against involuntary mouse movements, the
cursor stays at the chosen position after you perform a mouse
positioning command even if the mouse shifts by a couple pixels. The
chosen position will be marked with a yellow cross if that position is
different from the mouse position. To cause the cursor to resume
following the mouse, either move the mouse pointer a longer distance
or use the <b>Unstick mouse</b> (<code>u</code>) command. In addition,
the mouse may automatically become unstuck before you perform an
operation that would otherwise be redundant, such as adding the same
vertex to a curve twice in a row.

</ul>

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<h2><a id="Curve">Curve</a></h2>

<p>The first step of using curves is to <a href=#Smooth>make sure the
smoothing settings are correct</a>, which is easier than fixing them
later. The second step is to <a href=#AddVertex>add some points</a>.

<ul>

<li><p><b>Fill style</b> fills the interior of a closed curve with the
    chosen pattern in the current default color. You
    must <a href=#ToggleClosure>close the curve</a> before you can
    fill it.

  <p>Fill patterns can hide decorations underneath them, so you may
    need to <a href=Layer>lower the layer of the fill pattern</a>,
    raise the layer of those decorations, or use a partially
    transparent fill pattern. All fill patterns except the first,
    solid one are transparent.</p>

<li><p><b>Line style</b> changes the line style for the currently
    selected item, if any, and the initial style of any subsequently
    added items. Only curves and tie lines have line styles. The
    spacing of dots and dashes is proportional to the line width: if
    you reduce the width of a dashed line by half, then the length of
    the dashes is also reduced by half.</p>

<li><p><b>Line width</b> changes the line width for the currently
    selected item (if any) and the initial line width of any
    subsequently created items. Line width values apply to curves, tie
    lines, rulers, and arrowheads.</p>

<li><p>Select or unselect the <b id=Smooth>Smooth through new
      points</b> check box or press <code>s</code> to turn on or off
      curve smoothing for new points you add to curves. To change
      smoothing for an existing vertex,
      use <a href=#ToggleSmoothing>Toggle point smoothing</a>.

  <p>Unsmoothed curves of three or more points are presented as a
series of connected line segments or (for closed curves) a polygon.</p>

<li><p><b id=ToggleClosure>Toggle closure</b> (<code>o</code>) changes
    an open curve to a closed one or vice versa. All new curves are
    initially open. Closed curves have an extra segment looping back
    from the last vertex to the first. If that segment does not appear
    to be smoothed properly, you may need
    to <a href=#ToggleSmoothing>toggle smoothing</a> for one or
    both of the curve's endpoints.</p>

<li><p><b id=ToggleSmoothing>Toggle smoothing of selected point</b>
    (<code>,</code>, the comma key) changes the selected vertex from
    smoothed to un-smoothed or vice versa. To change the smoothing
    setting for a whole curve, toggle smoothing for each vertex
    individually.

<li><p><b>Select left vertex</b> (<code>[</code>) and <b>Select right
      vertex</b> (<code>]</code>) shift the selection one vertex to
      the left or right. You must have already selected a vertex.

</ul>

<p>Position the mouse where the new vertex goes and
press <code>x</code> or the left mouse button. To add a point at the
auto-position location instead, press <code>Shift+X</code>
or <code>Shift+left mouse button</code>.

<p>If a vertex (curve control point) is currently selected, then it is
marked by a small solid green circle. Other control points on the same
curve are indicated by small open green circles.</p>

<h3 id=NewCurve>Starting a new curve</h3>

<p>If a curve is already selected, press <code>Escape</code> to
deselect it.

<p>Position the mouse where the first vertex of the new curve belongs
and press <code>x</code> or the left mouse button. To start a new
curve at the auto-position location instead, hold down the shift key
as you do this.

<p>A curve consisting of a single point is represented as a dot twice
as wide as the current line width. It may be tempting to mark data
points this way, but for various reasons, it usually works better to
mark data points using 1-character labels.

<h3>Adding a point to a curve</h3>

<p>As described in the <code>Position Menu</code> section, you may
press <code>Shift+W</code> or <code>Shift+Q</code> to select a place
on the curve to add a new vertex.

<p>For curves, of at least two points, the program not only has a
selected vertex but a selected side where new points will be added.
The red line that follows the mouse should provide a hint which side
of the vertex is selected; if the red line is twisted, then you
probably want to move to the other side. You can shift the selected
vertex and the selected side of that vertex using <code>Select left
vertex</code> (<code>[</code>) or <code>Select right vertex</code>
(<code>]</code>).

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<h2><a id=Properties>Properties</a></h2>

<ul>

<li><b>Aspect Ratio</b>: change the ratio of the diagram's width to
its height by uniformly rescaling its horizontal dimension. This may
cause existing curve intersections to shift (so lines that used to
intersect may not quite do so anymore, or they may intersect at a
slightly different location), so it is best to set the aspect ratio
early in the editing process.

<li><p><b>Font</b>: The program uses variants of the DejaVu LGC Serif and
Sans Serif font families. <code>Serif (widely spaced lines)</code>
exists for backwards compatibility, and is not recommended for use in
new diagrams.</p>

<p>Currrently, you may only change the font for the entire diagram at
once.

<li><b>Key/Value Pairs</b>: Allows the user to store data in the form
of keys and values alongside the diagram. Except for the title, the
data are not displayed or otherwise used by the program.

<li><a id="Margins"><b>Margins</b></a>: If you need to align your
diagram in a specific way, or if you need to extend a diagram in any
direction, you may set the left, right, top, and bottom margins using
these menu options. <code>Auto-fit</code> eliminates excess white
space on all sides. It is a good idea to allow generous margins while
you are editing the diagram, and then select <code>Auto-fit</code>
when finished.

<li><b><a id=Scale>Scale</a></b>: This option allows you to change the
units of the X and Y axis, while the positions of items on the screen
remains the same. This option is most often used to change the axes'
initial ranges to the values you really want, but it can also be used
to change a diagram's range from Celsius to Kelvin, for example.

<p>If you highlight a ruler or line segment before choosing this
operation, the dialog will be initialized with its endpoints.

<li><b>Tags</b>: Allow the user to store free-form string data. The
data are not displayed or otherwise used by the program.

<li><b>Title</b>: Change the title of the diagram as displayed in the
menu bar and in printouts. To delete the title, change it to the empty
string ("").

<li><b><a id=Variable>Variables</a></b>: You can add new variables or
rename or delete existing ones. Variables must be defined as

  <blockquote><code>a x + b y + c</code></blockquote>

<p>where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are preexisting variables.

<p>New variables will be shown in the gray status bar at the bottom of
the edit window and may be used to define ruler tick mark values.

<li><p>Unchecking the <b>Show editing options</b> box hides options
related to diagram editing, which may make the program easier to
follow for users who do not need those options. Check the box to make
those options visible again.

</ul>

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<h2><a id=Digitize>Digitize</a></h2>

<ul>

<li><p><b>Export all text to clipboard</b>: Export all labels, key
values, tags, and diagram components to the clipboard, with duplicates
removed. Each entry is terminated by a newline.

<li><p><b>Export selected curve or label's coordinates</b>: You must
already have selected a <a href="#SelectCurve">curve</a>
or <a href="#SelectPoint">label or data point</a>. If you selected a
curve, this will export the coordinates of all of its control points
to a file or to the clipboard. If you selected a label or data point,
this will export the coordinates of all similar labels or data points.

<li><p><b>Export all curve and label coordinates</b>: Export the
coordinates of all curve control points and all labels to a file or to
the clipboard. Coordinates belonging to a single curve and labels that
share the same text are grouped together; groups are separated from
each other by empty lines or comments.

<p>Checking the <code>Add comments</code> box will make the output
easier to interpret but may make it harder to import the data into
other programs. Comments begin with the sharp sign (#).

<li><p><b>Import curve or label coordinates</b>: This is the reverse
of <b>Export all curve and label coordinates</b> and <b>Export
selected curve or label's coordinates</b>.

<p>If a curve was highlighted before this command was used, then
points will be added to it. If a label is highlighted, then similar
labels will be added. If nothing is highlighted, one or more new
curves will be created, with empty lines or lines that contain only a
comment (beginning with the sharp sign #) marking the beginning of a
new curve.

<p>Information about line styles and labels on exported data is not
used when the data are imported, so data that were exported usually
look different after they are imported again. That allows you to mark
data points and then draw a line or curve between them by exporting
and then reimporting data. If you have marked a set of data points
using labels containing identical symbols, then you can select one of
those symbols, choose <code>Export selected curve or label's
coordinates</code>, press <code>Escape</code> to deselect them, then
choose <code>Import label or curve coordinates</code> to create a
curve between those points.

</ul>

<h3>Digitization format</h3>

<p>All data imported from or exported to a file use the UTF-8
character encoding. If you export coordinates without comments,
however, the output file will contain ASCII characters only, so most
programs capable of reading plain text will be able to read and
display the file. (Do not, however, use Windows Notepad. Use WordPad
instead.)

<p>For coordinate import and export, the only format supported is any
number of text lines of either of two types. The first type of text
line defines a single coordinate pair in the form of a number, a
comma, and another number, possibly ending with a comment. The second
line type separates data sets; these lines are empty or contain
whitespace only, possibly followed by a comment. Any other line format
is an error, and additional characters such as parentheses are not
allowed.

<p>Comments start with a sharp sign (#) and extend to the end of the
line. Comments are ignored during data import.

<p>Numbers are exported as either fixed point ("-3.7") or floating
point ("1.7E15"). Imported numbers may be fixed point, floating point,
fractions ("1/3"), or percentages ("37.2%").

<p>If you need to export data in ways that are more advanced than
these menu items allow, you could work directly from the PED files,
which are in human-readable JSON format. The PED file format does not
have a formal specification and may change, but looking at PED files
in a text editor may give you an idea what is involved.</p>

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<h2><a id=Chemistry>Chemistry</a></h2>

<ul>

<li><p><b>Components</b>: Identify the diagram components for binary
and ternary diagrams. Binary diagrams whose X-axis indicates
increasing the relative proportions of substance A versus substance B
have a left and right diagram component, while ternary diagrams have a
left, right, and top component. In this context, the diagram
components are the compounds that correspond to 0 and 100% of your
independent variables, even if the displayed domain is a subset of
that.

<p>You must identify the diagram components in a way the program can
understand before most of the chemistry functions can be used.

<p><i><a id="chemical_syntax">Chemical formula syntax</a></i>: The
program understands simple chemical formulas, possibly including
parentheses or square brackets, as well as simple chemical formulas
combined with leading coefficients and plus signs or colons (for
example: <code>CO:6H<sub>2</sub>O</code>). Numbers may be entered as
integers, fractions, fixed-point decimals, or percentages.

<p>As soon as all diagram components are defined, the gray status bar
will show additional information about points on the screen. If a
position in the diagram corresponds precisely to a round formula, that
formula will be shown; otherwise, a decimal approximation is shown.
Component values will be shown as a pair <code>mole percent/weight
percent</code>.

<p>The chemistry functions work best and the status bar shows the most
information if coordinates are entered exactly, with values like 1/3 entered as 1/3 instead of as 0.33.

<p>Also pay attention to your percent symbols and to the <code>Use
percentages in labels</code> check box that appears in the "Edit
Ruler" dialog. If you wish to show percentage values (that is, values
that are 100 times greater than the proportion values) in a ruler,
that box should be checked. Check the status bar: a proportion such as
77% should be displayed as either "0.77" or "77%". If 77% displays as
"77" or "7700%" in the status bar, then you need
to <a href="#Scale">update the scale</a> for that variable, mapping
old values of 0 and 100 to new values of 0 and 1, respectively.

<li><p>If you have already created labels in your diagram for all of
the diagram components, you may use the <b>Guess components</b>
feature to automatically set the components. There is no guarantee
that the guesses will be correct.

<li><p><b>Proportions/Already displaying weight fraction</b>: The
program assumes that coordinates inside the diagram are defined by
mole fraction or mole percent instead of weight fraction/weight
percent, until you tell it differently. (In other words, it assumes
that a point located halfway between a concentration of 0% and 100% of
a given component corresponds to a 50-50 molecular or atomic ratio,
not a 50-50 weight ratio.) If the first element of the supposed mole
percent/weight percent pair is actually showing the weight percent,
then you need to check this box to tell the program that the
coordinates are based on weight fraction or weight percent values. If
the second element of the pair is actually showing mole fraction or
mole percent, then you need to un-check this box to tell the program
the diagram is not showing weight percent values.

<li><p><b>Proportions/Convert to [weight/mole] fraction</b>: Transform
the entire diagram between weight and mole fraction values.

<p>There is no guarantee that every point on every curve of the
diagram will be correct after you perform a conversion. The diagram
may look funny, especially if there is a wide divergence between the
mole and weight percents. Arrows and isotherm labels may no longer
align with the curves they annotate.

<li><p><b>Copy all formulas to clipboard</b>: Copy all unique formulas
in the diagram to the clipboard in alphabetical order, one per line.
For example, if there is a label that reads "Salt In H2O", then the
formula list will include "In", for Indium, and "H2O".

<li><p><b>Formula to mole/weight fraction</b> (also available by
pressing the <code>%</code> key, that is <code>Shift+5</code> on US
keyboards): Enter a chemical formula, and the molecular weight of the
that formula and its representation in the Hill system will be
displayed. You can also use this to check whether the program can
parse the expression for use as a diagram component.

<p>If the diagram components are properly defined and the formula
corresponds to a point inside the diagram, you may press the <b>Locate
compound in diagram</b> button to go there. A final step might be
to <a href="#Label">create a label</a> at that point. In Microsoft
Windows, you can press <code>Control-V</code> to paste your formula
into the text window.

<p>Once you have zoomed in, you can use <b id=BestFit>Best fit</b>
(<code>Control+B</code>) to zoom all the way back out again.

<p>If you are tracing an image, you may use the <b>Background

in the background of the new diagram. <b>Hide</b>
(<code>Control+H</code>) changes the original image from visible to
hidden and vice versa. <b>Detach</b> permanently removes the linkage
from the new diagram to the original image; the background image
disappears and the Zoom window closes.

<p>The <b id=SlopeWindow>Show slope window</b> checkbox can be used to
close or reopen the slope window, which shows the slope of the second
principal variable with respect to the first one at the most recently

      the label will be centered at the anchor or will have a corner
      or center of one side located there. The anchors use the text's
      frame of reference: for example, if the label reads "Foo" and
      the lower right button is selected, then the corner of the F
      will lie closest to the anchor, no matter what text angle is
      selected.

    <p>If you check the box for <b id=LabelWhiteBackground>White label
      background</b>, a white rectangle will be printed behind the
      label. White label backgrounds only obscure decorations in lower
      layers, so you may need to <a href="#Layer">raise the label</a>
      as well.

    <p>If you check the box for <b id=LabelWhiteHoles>White character
        holes</b>, the insides of hollow letters and characters will
        be painted white. This option is mostly useful for symbols,
        and it insures that a hollow circle stands out when plotted
        over a solid line. White character holes only obscure
        decorations in lower layers, so you may need
        to <a href="#Layer">raise the label</a> as well.

    <p>To label isotherms, first use <a href="#NearestCurve">Nearest
        Line/Curve</a> or <a href="#SelectPoint">Select Nearest
        Point</a> to position the mouse over the curve you wish to
        label. The angle value in the <a href="#SlopeWindow">slope
        window</a> should change to match the curve. From
        the <b>Edit Text</b> dialog, set <b>Label angle</b> to equal
        the angle you saw in the slope window and
        check <a href="#LabelWhiteBackground">White label
        background</a> to make the label stand out.

    <p>If you check the box for <b>Label border</b>, the label will be
      surrounded by a thin border.

    <p>The <a href="#Copy">copy command</a> is the best way to create
      many duplicates of a label, such as when marking data
      points.</p>

    <p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<li><p><b id=Arrowhead>Right Arrowhead</b> (<code>&gt;</code>) draws
    an arrowhead that points at the angle indicated in the "Slope"
    window. <b>Left Arrowhead</b> (<code>&lt;</code>) draws an
    arrowhead that points in the opposite direction, press '&lt;'. The
    size of the arrowhead is determined by the line width indicated in
    the "Slope" window.</p>

    <p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<li><p><b id=Ruler>Ruler</b> creates a ruler or axis. However, you
    must create and select a line segment that marks the ruler's
    endpoints first. If you have done this, a window will open to
    allow you to edit the ruler's properties.</p>

  <p>There is currently no way to automatically generate a ruler that
    displays weight percent values in a mole-percent diagram or vice
    versa. All you can do is convert the entire diagram between the
    two states.</p>

  <p>Rulers display the values of variables or components. Instead of
    telling the system that you want the ruler to go from 0 to 1, you
    tell which variable you want to display. If no variable goes from
    0 to 1 in the range you want, you can <a href="#Variable">create
    one</a>.

  <p><b>Tick labels</b>: Controls whether to show numbers next to big
    tick marks. Small ticks are never labeled.

  <p><b>Label angle with respect to axis</b>: A zero degree angle
    means that the labels are parallel to the ruler axis (which does
    not mean that the label text is horizontal unless the ruler itself
    is horizontal). Positive angles are clockwise with respect to
    that.

  <p>By default, the program will assign reasonable tick values and
    tick distances, but you can tweak these values in a number of
    ways.

  <p>When drawing two rulers that cross in the middle, such as for a
    Cartesian graph that displays four quadrants for the negative and
    positive X and Y values, there may be difficulties where the
    rulers cross (typically at the origin). The X-axis label at x=0
    will typically be overstruck by the Y-axis, and the Y-axis label
    at y=0 will typically be overstruck by the X-axis. A solution to
    that is to replace each individual ruler with two separate ones
    that lie along the same line and meet at the origin, and to check
    the boxes to suppress the rulers' start or end ticks and labels.

  <p><b>Minimum white space between tick labels, in multiples of label
      height</b>: If you do not explicitly tell the ruler where to put
      the ticks, the program tries to figure out on its own how close
      together the ticks can be without causing the labels to crowd
      each other. (That applies even if the labels are turned off.)
      You can increase the minimum separation between labels by
      entering larger values here. This is only a minimum value, and
      the actual tick step will be a round number large enough to
      exceed this minimum, which means that depending on specifics, a
      slight change to this value may not affect the actual tick step.
      Generally speaking, a value of 0 means that labels will be
      fairly close together, while a value of 3 means that the labels
      are more widely spaced.

  <p><b>Big tick step size (optional)</b>: You may specify what the
    difference between big ticks should be or leave this blank to
    allow the program to choose a reasonable value. On its own, the
    program will always choose values that are 1, 2, or 5 times a
    power of 10.

  <p><b>Small tick step size (optional)</b>: You may specify what the
    difference between big ticks should be or leave this blank to
    allow the program to choose a reasonable value (normally the next
    round number less than the big tick step size).

  <p><b>Minimum/maximum tick value (optional)</b>: Usually you want
    the ticks to extend the length of the ruler, possibly leaving out
    the start or endpoints. In that case, leave this blank. But if you
    want to explicitly specify the minimum and maximum tick values,
    you may do so here.

  <p><b>Left/right/top/bottom-side tick marks</b>: Check or uncheck to
    remove the tick marks on the given side of the axis.

  <p><b>V-shaped tick marks</b> are used mainly for ternary diagrams.
    Check this box if you need them.

  <p><b>Use percentages in labels</b>: If you check this, the labels
    will display values that are 100 times greater than the underlying
    variable. As mentioned in the <code>Chemistry Menu</code> section,
    if you are showing percentage values, then you should insure this
    box is checked; and if the values you get look right even when the
    box is not checked, you should probably decrease the underlying
    variable by a factor of 100, especially if you hope to use any of
    the chemistry functions.

  <p><b>Start/End arrow</b>: Check this box to add an arrow at the
    ends of the axis.

  <p><b>Suppress start/end tick</b>: Check this box to suppress any
    tick marks that might otherwise appear at the start/end of the
    ruler. to be there.

  <p><b>Suppress start/end label</b>: Check this box to suppress any
    label that might otherwise appear at the start or end of the
    ruler.

  <p><b>Suppress small ticks:</b> Check this to prevent all small tick
    marks from being displayed.

        <p>If tie lines connect two segments or curves, instead of
          connecting a curve to a point, then the tie lines should
          tend to converge to a point someplace outside of the region
          defined by the tie lines. If that is not the case, then the
          Tie Line decoration may not be suited to your need, and you
          may need to draw the individal tie lines manually.

<li><h3 id=Edit>Edit selection / Edit nearest item popup menus</h3>

  <p>The commands in the <b>Edit selection</b> menu apply to the
    currently selected item, usually highlighted
    in <span style="color:green;">green</span>. If no item is
    selected, the <b>Edit nearest item</b> menu allows you to apply
    some of these operations to the item closest to the mouse pointer.</p>

    <ul>

      <li><p><b id=Color>Color</b> (<code>r</code>) changes the item's
          color. If the selection is highlighted, you will not see its
          true color until you deselect it. The color you choose
          becomes the default color for new decorations until you
          change it again.

        <p>White decorations may seem to disappear, and curves and
          labels that are filled in white may make items in
          lower <a href="#Layer">layers</a> seem to disappear.</p>

      <li><p><b id=Copy>Copy</b> (<code>c</code>) creates a new
          copy of the selection at the current mouse position.</p>

      <li><p><b id=CopyRegion>Copy everything in selected region</b>
            (<code>Shift+C</code>) copies all decorations that are
            entirely contained in that region.</p>

      <li><p><b id=Delete>Delete</b> (<code>Delete</code>)
          deletes a single vertex or decoration.</p>

      <li><p><b id=DeleteAll>Delete all</b> deletes a curve, if a
          curve is the selected or nearest item, or all labels that
          share the same text, if a label is the selected or nearest
          item. Otherwise, it deletes the selected or nearest
          decoration.</p>

      <li><p>The <b id=Layer>Layer</b> menu determines the order in
          which decorations are printed. Lower layers are printed
          before higher layers -- to put it another way, the lower
          layers form the background for the higher layers. For
          instance, if you have two decorations that intersect, and
          one is solid black while the other is solid red, then the
          intersection will be red if the red decoration is higher or
          black if the black decoration is higher. New decorations are
          initially placed above all old ones.

        <p>Plain black decorations never stand out against a black
          background, regardless of layering, because the "white"
          parts of the decoration are just holes that allow the
          background to show through. To make a label stand out
          against a black background, color the label non-black or
          check <a href="#LabelWhiteBackground">White label
          background</a> or, for data points,
          possibly <a href="#LabelWhiteHoles">White character
          holes</a>. In either case, the label needs to be moved to a
          higher layer than the background before it can be
          visible.</p>

        <p><b>Lower</b> moves the selected or nearest item farther
          into the background, while <b>Raise</b> moves the item
          closer to the foreground. <b>To bottom</b> moves the item
          all the way into the background, and <b>To top</b> moves the
          item all the way into the foreground.</p>

      <li><p><b>Move selection only</b> (<code>Shift+V</code>) moves
          the selected vertex or item to the current mouse position.</p>

        <p>When moving labels that are not anchored in the center, it
          makes a difference whether you select the label's center
          (the green circle is empty) or its anchor (the green circle
          is solid). Even if a label is anchored on the upper left
          corner, for example, a label whose center is moved will end
          up with its center, not the upper-left corner, at the new
          position.</p>

      <li><p><b>Move everything at selected point</b> (<code>v</code>)
          moves the selected vertex or item and all other items at the
          same location.</p>

      <li><p><b>Move everything in selected region</b>
          (<code>Shift+R</code>) moves the selected curve or ruler and
          all selectable key points that lie on or in that curve or
          ruler. This is most often used with closed curves.</p>

      <li><p><b>Properties</b> (<code>e</code>) brings up a special
          menu to edit the selected item's properties. Labels, rulers,
          and tie lines may be edited this way.</p>

      <li><p><b>Revert properties to default</b> (<code>d</code>)
          changes the selected item's color, line thickness (if
          applicable), and line style (if applicable) to the current
          default values.</p>

      <li><p><b>Make selection's properties the new default</b>
          (<code>Shift+D</code>) changes the current default values
          for color, line thickness (if applicable), and line style
          (if applicable) to match the selected item.</p>

        <p>Pressing <code>Shift+D</code> on one item and then
          pressing <code>d</code> on others is a quick way to change
          many things to match the first thing.</p>

<h2>Drawing common shapes</h2>

<h3 id=Rectangle>Rectangle</h3>

<p>To draw a rectangle as a 4-point unsmoothed curve:

<ol> 

<li>If necessary, <a href="#Smooth">unselect the <code>Curve/Smooth
  through new points</code> check box</a>. Also, if a curve is already
  selected, press <code>Escape</code> to unselect it.

<li>Add the bottom left corner of the rectangle using any of the
various mouse positioning methods described elsewhere.

<li>Move the mouse near the intended bottom right corner and
press <code>Shift+left mouse button</code>.

<li>Move the mouse near the intended upper right corner and
  press <code>Shift+left mouse button</code>.

<li><a href=#ToggleClosure>Press <code>o</code></a> to make a closed
polygon.

<li>Move the mouse near the intended upper left corner and
  press <code>Shift+left mouse button</code> when you see the
  olive-colored crosshairs.

</ol>

<h3 id=Parallel>Parallel lines</h3>

<p>To create vertical or horizontal lines, just use the Shift key for
auto-positioning. To create other parallel lines:</p>

<ol>

<li>Add the first vertex of the line using one of the procedures
already described. Let the new vertex remain selected.

<li>Press <code>w</code> to select the line you want the new line to
  be parallel to. This will enter the slope of that line in the Slope
  window so auto-position will prefer points at the given slope with
  respect to your first vertex.

<li>Move the mouse near the other intended endpoint and
  press <code>Shift+left mouse button</code>.

</ol>

<h3 id=Circle>Circle</h3>

<p>The program does not currently support perfect circles, but a close
approximation can be obtained with the same procedure
as <a href=#Rectangle>how to draw a rectangle</a> to draw a rough
square, with one difference: make sure that <code>Curve/Smooth through
new points</code> is checked before you start. A smoothed curve
through the four corners of an almost square rectangle is almost
circular.
