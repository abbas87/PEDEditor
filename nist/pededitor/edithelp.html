<h1>PED Edit Window Help</h1>

<p><i>Please note that this file will open using the default browser
you have chosen for your computer, either full- or partial-screen,
according to its last usage. If the last view was not full screen, the
PED Figure Search interface will remain partially visible
underneath.</i>

<p>The PED (Phase Equilibria Diagram) Editor was written by Eric
Boesch to digitize phase diagrams for the PED Data Center. The editor
can also be used for general scientifc drawing and two-dimensional
visualization. The latest version is available for downloading as
freeware with some restrictions;
see <a href="http://www.nist.gov/srd/nist31.cfm">http://www.nist.gov/srd/nist31.cfm</a>.

<p>Some features may be accessed through the menu bar along the top
edge of the Viewer screen, while others are accessed through a menu
that is raised by pressing the right mouse button (if your mouse does
not have a right button, use whatever control you normally use to
raise popup menus). These functions (and their keyboard shortcuts) are
described below.

<h2><a id="File">File</a></h2>

<h3>New diagram</h3>

<p>Create a new diagram from scratch. If you wish to digitize a
scanned image of an existing diagram, use the
<a href="#open"><code>File/Open</code></a> option instead.</p>

<p>You are presented with a selection of diagram types. Select the
"Binary or Cartesian" type for Cartesian graphs, binary diagrams,
quaternary diagrams, and all other diagrams based on a rectangular
graph. For ternary diagrams, select one of the "Ternary" subtypes. If
none of the given categories apply, select the "Free-form" type to
start with a blank page.

<h3><a id="open">Open</a></h3>

<p>Open either an image file saved in GIF, JPEG, or PNG format or a
diagram that was previously saved in this program's native PED
format.</p>

<p>If you open an image file, a window will open that allows you to
select the boundary of a diagram within that image and then create a
new diagram traced from the old one. That window has its own Help menu
option which provides more information.</p>

<h3>Save / Save as PED</h3>

<p>Save a diagram as a file in this program's native PED format. This
is the only choice that allows you to reload the diagram later with
this program and continue where you left off.</p>

<h3>Save as PDF</h3>

<p>Save an image of the diagram. Diagrams saved as PDF stay sharp at
higher magnification.

<h3>Save as PNG</h3>
<h3>Save as GIF</h3>
<h3>Save as JPEG</h3>

<p>Save an image of the diagram. Diagrams saved in these formats do
not stay sharp at higher magnification.

<h3>Print</h3>

<p>Print the diagram. The image will be scaled so that its margins
just fit on the sheet. You can make the printed image appear smaller
or larger by <a href="#Margins">adjusting the margins</a>.

<h3>Next File</h3>

<p>(<code>Control+Right Arrow</code>) Switch to the next selected
diagram, if any. This option is only enabled if you opened multiple
files at once.

<h3>Refresh</h3>

<p>Refresh the current diagram from disk if the diagram was previously
opened or saved in PED format.

<h3>Close</h3>

<p>Close this diagram only.

<h3>Exit</h3>

<p>Close all diagrams and exit the program.

<h3>Refresh</h3>

<p>Refresh the current diagram from disk if the diagram was previously
opened or saved in PED format.

<h2><a id="Position">Position</a></h2>

<p>This menu includes functions to move the mouse pointer within the diagram.

<h3 id=Autoposition>Auto-positioning</h3>

<p>Holding the shift key down while moving the mouse causes the mouse
to be attracted to nearby curves and points of special interest,
including

<ul>

<li><a href="#NearestPoint">Key points</a> are highlighted in olive.

<li><b>Curves and rulers</b>: If no key point is close, the nearest
point on a curve or ruler may be highlighted in orange.

<li><p><b>Vertical and horizontal lines</b>: If an item is selected,
then for purposes of identifying key points and curves, the program
behaves as if the diagram contains invisible horizontal and vertical
lines through the selection point, if any.

<li><p>The program may also include invisible lines through the
selection at <b>other special angles</b>. These angles include the
value indicated in <a href=#MathWindow>the math window</a>, lines
in ternary diagrams at 60 or 120 degrees, and lines of zero change for
user-defined variables created using
<a href="#Variable"><code>Properties/Variables/Add</code></a>.
</ul>

<p>Sometimes the auto-positioning is attracted by a key point that
prevents you from clicking on what you really want. You may sidestep
this problem by <a href="#DragToZoom">zooming in</a> until the screen
distance becomes large enough that the key point no longer attracts
the mouse pointer.</p>

<ul>

<li><b><a id="Enter">Enter coordinates</a></b> (<code>Enter</code>) allows you to type
in the coordinates you would like the mouse to move to. If you enter
coordinates that are off the diagram page, the page will be enlarged
to put the position on its edge.

<li><p><b>Jump to selection</b> (<code>j</code>) moves the mouse
pointer to the currently selected item, if an item is
selected.</p></li>

<li><p>To protect users against involuntary mouse movements, the
cursor stays at the chosen position after you perform a mouse
positioning command even if the mouse shifts by a couple pixels. The
chosen position will be marked with a yellow cross if that position is
different from the mouse position. To cause the cursor to resume
following the mouse, either move the mouse pointer a longer distance
or use the <b>Unstick mouse</b> (<code>u</code>) command. In addition,
the mouse may automatically become unstuck before you perform an
operation that would otherwise be redundant, such as adding the same
vertex to a curve twice in a row.

</ul>

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<h2><a id="Curve">Curve</a></h2>

<p>The first step of using curves is to <a href=#Smooth>make sure the
smoothing settings are correct</a>, which is easier than fixing them
later. The second step is to <a href=#AddVertex>add some points</a>.

<ul>

<li><p><b>Fill style</b> fills the interior of a closed curve with the
    chosen pattern in the current default color. You
    must <a href=#ToggleClosure>close the curve</a> before you can
    fill it.

  <p>Fill patterns can hide decorations underneath them, so you may
    need to <a href="#Layer">lower the layer of the fill pattern</a>,
    raise the layer of those decorations, or use a partially
    transparent fill pattern. All fill patterns except the first,
    solid one are transparent.</p>

<li><p><b>Line style</b> changes the line style for the currently
    selected item, if any, and the initial style of any subsequently
    added items. Only curves and tie lines have line styles. The
    spacing of dots and dashes is proportional to the line width: if
    you reduce the width of a dashed line by half, then the length of
    the dashes is also reduced by half.</p>

<li><p><b>Line width</b> changes the line width for the currently
    selected item (if any) and the initial line width of any
    subsequently created items. Line width values apply to curves, tie
    lines, rulers, and arrowheads.</p>

<li><p>Select or unselect the <b id=Smooth>Smooth through new
      points</b> check box or press <code>s</code> to turn on or off
      curve smoothing for new points you add to curves. To change
      smoothing for an existing vertex,
      use <a href=#ToggleSmoothing>Toggle point smoothing</a>.

  <p>Unsmoothed curves of three or more points are presented as a
series of connected line segments or (for closed curves) a polygon.</p>

<li><p><b id=ToggleClosure>Toggle closure</b> (<code>o</code>) changes
    an open curve to a closed one or vice versa. All new curves are
    initially open. Closed curves have an extra segment looping back
    from the last vertex to the first. If that segment does not appear
    to be smoothed properly, you may need
    to <a href=#ToggleSmoothing>toggle smoothing</a> for one or
    both of the curve's endpoints.</p>

<li><p><b id=ToggleSmoothing>Toggle smoothing of selected point</b>
    (<code>,</code>, the comma key) changes the selected vertex from
    smoothed to un-smoothed or vice versa. To change the smoothing
    setting for a whole curve, toggle smoothing for each vertex
    individually.

<li><p><b>Select left vertex</b> (<code>[</code>) and <b>Select right
      vertex</b> (<code>]</code>) shift the selection one vertex to
      the left or right. You must have already selected a vertex.

</ul>

<p>Position the mouse where the new vertex goes and
press <code>x</code> or the left mouse button. To add a point at the
auto-position location instead, press <code>Shift+X</code>
or <code>Shift+left mouse button</code>.

<p>If a vertex (curve control point) is currently selected, then it is
marked by a small solid green circle. Other control points on the same
curve are indicated by small open green circles.</p>

<h3 id=NewCurve>Starting a new curve</h3>

<p>If an item is already selected, press <code>Escape</code> to
deselect it.

<p>Position the mouse where the first vertex of the new curve belongs
and press <code>x</code> or the left mouse button. To start a new
curve at the auto-position location instead, hold down the shift key
as you do this.

<p>A curve consisting of a single point is represented as a dot with a
radius double the current line width. It may be tempting to mark data
points this way, but for various reasons, it usually works better to
mark data points using 1-character labels.

<h3>Adding a point to a curve</h3>

<p>As described in the <code>Position Menu</code> section, you may
press <code>Shift+W</code> or <code>Shift+Q</code> to select a place
on the curve to add a new vertex.

<p>For curves of at least two points, the program not only has a
selected vertex but a selected side where new points will be added.
The red line that follows the mouse should provide a hint which side
of the vertex is selected; if the red line is twisted, then you
probably want to move to the other side. You can shift the selected
vertex and the selected side of that vertex using <code>Select left
vertex</code> (<code>[</code>) or <code>Select right vertex</code>
(<code>]</code>).

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<h2><a id=Properties>Properties</a></h2>

<ul>

<li><b>Aspect Ratio</b>: change the ratio of the diagram's width to
its height by uniformly rescaling its horizontal dimension. This may
cause existing curve intersections to shift (so lines that used to
intersect may not quite do so anymore, or they may intersect at a
slightly different location), so it is best to set the aspect ratio
early in the editing process.

<li><p><b>Font</b>: The program uses variants of the DejaVu LGC Serif
and Sans Serif font families. <code>Serif (widely spaced lines)</code>
exists for backwards compatibility, and is not recommended for use in
new diagrams.</p>

<p>Currrently, you may only change the font for the entire diagram at
once.

<li><b>Key/Value Pairs</b>: Allows the user to store data in the form
of keys and values alongside the diagram. Except for the title, the
data are not displayed or otherwise used by the program.

<li><a id="Margins"><b>Margins</b></a>: <code>Expand all</code> adds
extra space on all sides. Afterward you can use <code>Auto-fit</code>
to eliminate all excess white space. Use <code>Set</code> to manually
assign values to the page X and Y boundaries. If
you <a href="#Rectangle">select a rectangle</a> before
choosing <code>Set</code>, that rectangle will define the new margins.

<li><h3 id=PixelMode>Pixel mode</h3>

  <p>Pixel mode is only available for diagrams of type "Picture or
    map" that have uniform aspect (the X and Y units have equal length).
    It is intended for drawing icons or other pixelated pictures whose
    edges should align with pixel boundaries for maximum sharpness.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Curve endpoints are squared off instead of rounded
    <li><code>Show Grid</code> is turned on
    <li>Line width is initially set to one user unit wide
    <li>When you press the mouse button to add a point or press 'g' to
    go to the nearest grid point, the mouse aligns to the nearest
    half-grid width. Grid lines are useful for outlining fill regions,
    whereas grid box centers (halfway between grid lines) are good for creating
    curves.
    <li>When creating a new curve, starting on a grid line starts a
      fill region by default, whereas starting in the center of a grid
      box starts a curve.
    <li>Unfilled curves containing just a single point appear as
      one-unit squares. So if you click in the center of a grid box
      and then press <code>End</code>, you fill that single
      pixel.</li>
  </ul>

<!--  <p>Turning on pixel mode also enables <a href="#Snap">Snap to
      grid</a>.-->

<li><b id=Scale>Scale</b>: This option allows you to change the
units of the X and Y axis, while the positions of items on the screen
remains the same. This feature allows you to change from units of
Celsius to Kelvin, for example, or grams to kilograms.

<p>If you highlight a ruler or line segment before choosing this
operation, the dialog will be initialized with its endpoint values.

<!-- <li><b id=Snap>Snap to grid</b> aligns (imperfectly) control points
with pixel boundaries unless that would cause two different positions
to overlap. It is only available in <a href=#PixelMode>pixel mode</a>. -->

  <li><b>Swap X and Y axes</b> more or less reflects the diagram
  across a mirror angled 45 degrees upwards. Not available for
  diagrams with components or ternary diagrams.

<li><b>Tags</b>: Allow the user to store free-form string data. The
data are not displayed or otherwise used by the program.

<li><b>Title</b>: Change the title of the diagram as displayed in the
menu bar and in printouts. To delete the title, change it to the empty
string ("").

<li><b><a id=Variable>Variables</a></b>: You can add or delete a
variable, rename a variable, or change whether a variable and its
rulers are displayed as percentages. Variables must be defined as

  <blockquote><code>a x + b y + c</code></blockquote>

<p>where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are preexisting variables.
In this program, variable values must change at a constant rate as you
move across the diagram. You cannot define a single variable whose
value changes at a varying rate or has the same value in two different
places (such as in insets that magnify part of the main diagram).
Where a logical variable's value has discontinuities or overlaps, the
best you can do is to define several variables such that at least one
of those variables displays correctly at each point.

<p>New variables will be shown in the gray status bar at the bottom of
the edit window and may be used to define rulers.

<li><p>Unchecking the <b>Show editing options</b> box hides options
related to diagram editing, which may make the program easier to
follow for users who do not need those options. Check the box to make
those options visible again.

<li><p>Unchecking the <b>Hide original image when saving or printing</b> box causes the original image to be hidden when you save as any image type or you print the diagram. This is useful if you included the original image only for reference, not intending to include it in output files. Check the box to undo this effect.

</ul>

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<h2><a id=Digitize>Digitize</a></h2>

<ul>

<li><p><b>Export text to clipboard</b>: Export all labels, key values,
tags, and diagram components to the clipboard, with duplicates and
HTML tags removed. Each entry is terminated by a newline. If you
selected a label, then only that label is exported.

<li><p><b>Export selected curve or label's coordinates</b>: You must
already have selected a <a href="#SelectCurve">curve</a>
or <a href="#SelectPoint">label or data point</a>. If you selected a
curve, this will export the coordinates of all of its control points
to a file or to the clipboard. If you selected a label or data point,
this will export the coordinates of all similar labels or data points.

<li><p><b>Export all curve and label coordinates</b>: Export the
coordinates of all curve control points and all labels to a file or to
the clipboard. Coordinates belonging to a single curve and labels that
share the same text are grouped together; groups are separated from
each other by empty lines or comments.

<p>Checking the <code>Add comments</code> box will make the output
easier to interpret but may make it harder to import the data into
other programs. Comments begin with the sharp sign (#).

<li><p><b>Import curve or label coordinates</b>: This is the reverse
of <b>Export all curve and label coordinates</b> and <b>Export
selected curve or label's coordinates</b>.

<p>If a curve was highlighted before this command was used, then
points will be added to it. If a label is highlighted, then similar
labels will be added. If nothing is highlighted, one or more new
curves will be created, with empty lines or lines that contain only a
comment (beginning with the sharp sign #) marking the beginning of a
new curve.

<p>Information about line styles and labels on exported data is not
used when the data are imported, so data that were exported usually
look different after they are imported again. That allows you to mark
data points and then draw a line or curve between them by exporting
and then reimporting data. If you have marked a set of data points
using labels containing identical symbols, then you can select one of
those symbols, choose <code>Export selected curve or label's
coordinates</code>, press <code>Escape</code> to deselect them, then
choose <code>Import label or curve coordinates</code> to create a
curve between those points.

</ul>

<h3>Digitization format</h3>

<p>All data imported from or exported to a file use the UTF-8
character encoding. If you export coordinates without comments,
however, the output file will contain ASCII characters only, so most
programs capable of reading plain text will be able to read and
display the file. (Do not, however, use Windows Notepad. Use WordPad
instead.)

<p>For coordinate import and export, the only format supported is any
number of text lines of either of two types. The first type of text
line defines a single coordinate pair in the form of a number, a
comma, and another number, possibly ending with a comment. The second
line type separates data sets; these lines are empty or contain
whitespace only, possibly followed by a comment. Any other line format
is an error, and additional characters such as parentheses are not
allowed.

<p>Comments start with a sharp sign (#) and extend to the end of the
line. Comments are ignored during data import.

<p>Numbers are exported as either fixed point ("-3.7") or floating
point ("1.7E15"). Imported numbers may be fixed point, floating point,
fractions ("1/3"), or percentages ("37.2%").

<p>If you need to export data in ways that are more advanced than
these menu items allow, you could work directly from the PED files,
which are in human-readable JSON format. The PED file format does not
have a formal specification and may change, but looking at PED files
in a text editor may give you an idea what is involved.</p>

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<h2><a id=Chemistry>Chemistry</a></h2>

<ul>

<li><p><b>Set components</b>: Identify the diagram components for binary
and ternary diagrams. Binary diagrams whose X-axis indicates
increasing the relative proportions of two substances have a left and
right diagram component, while ternary diagrams have a left, right,
and top component. In this context, the diagram components are the
compounds that correspond to 0 and 100% of your independent variables,
even if the displayed domain is a subset of that.

<p>You must identify the diagram components in a way the program can
understand before most of the chemistry functions can be used.

<p><i><a id="chemical_syntax">Chemical formula syntax</a></i>: The
program understands simple chemical formulas, possibly including
parentheses or square brackets, as well as simple chemical formulas
combined with leading coefficients and plus signs or colons (for
example: <code>CO:6H<sub>2</sub>O</code>). Numbers may be entered as
integers, fractions, fixed-point decimals, or percentages.

<p>As soon as all diagram components are defined, the gray status bar
at the bottom of the edit window will show additional information
about points on the screen. If a position in the diagram matches a
round formula exactly, that formula will be shown; otherwise, a
decimal approximation is shown. Component values will be shown as a
pair <code>mole percent/weight percent</code>.

<p>The chemistry functions work best and the status bar shows the most
information if coordinates are entered exactly, with values like 1/3 entered as 1/3 instead of as 0.33.

<p>Also pay attention to your percent symbols and to the <code>Use
percentages in labels</code> check box that appears in the "Edit
Ruler" dialog. If you wish to show percentage values (that is, values
that are 100 times greater than the proportion values) in a ruler,
that box should be checked. Check the status bar: a proportion such as
77% should be displayed as either "0.77" or "77%". If 77% displays as
"77" or "7700%" in the status bar, then you need
to <a href="#Scale">update the scale</a> for that variable, mapping
old values of 0 and 100 to new values of 0 and 1, respectively.

<li><p>If you have already created labels in your diagram for all of
the diagram components, you may use the <b>Guess components</b>
feature to automatically set the components. There is no guarantee
that the guesses will be correct.

<li><p><b>Swap components</b> exchanges the position of the left and
right components in binary diagrams. For ternary diagrams, any pair of
components may be swapped, but the diagram may look odd after swapping
the top component. All three components can be reordered using
successive swaps.

<li><p><b>Proportions/Already displaying weight fraction</b>: The
program assumes that coordinates inside the diagram are defined by
mole fraction or mole percent instead of weight fraction/weight
percent, until you tell it differently. (In other words, it assumes
that a point located halfway between a concentration of 0% and 100% of
a given component corresponds to a 50-50 molecular or atomic ratio,
not a 50-50 weight ratio.) If the first element of the supposed mole
percent/weight percent pair is actually showing the weight percent,
then you need to check this box to tell the program that the
coordinates are based on weight fraction or weight percent values. If
the second element of the pair is actually showing mole fraction or
mole percent, then you need to un-check this box to tell the program
the diagram is not showing weight percent values.

<li><p><b>Proportions/Convert to [weight/mole] fraction</b>: Transform
the entire diagram between weight and mole fraction values.

<p>There is no guarantee that every point on every curve of the
diagram will be correct after you perform a conversion. The diagram
may look funny, especially if there is a wide divergence between the
mole and weight percents. Arrows and isotherm labels may no longer
align with the curves they annotate.

<li><p><b>Copy all formulas to clipboard</b>: Copy all unique formulas
in the diagram to the clipboard in alphabetical order, one per line.
For example, if there is a label that reads "Salt In H2O", then the
formula list will include "In", for Indium, and "H2O".

<li><p><b>Formula to mole/weight fraction</b> (also available by
pressing the <code>%</code> key, that is <code>Shift+5</code> on US
keyboards): Enter a chemical formula, and the molecular weight of the
that formula and its representation in the Hill system will be
displayed. You can also use this to check whether the program can
parse the expression for use as a diagram component.

<p>If the diagram components are properly defined and the formula
corresponds to a point inside the diagram, you may press the <b>Locate
compound in diagram</b> button to go there. A final step might be
to <a href="#Label">create a label</a> at that point. In Microsoft
Windows, you can press <code>Control-V</code> to paste your formula
into the text window.

        (<code>Shift+Q</code>) moves the mouse to decoration anchors
        and curve vertexes, including

        <ul>
          <li>arrows
          <li>curve vertex
          <li>label anchors and label centers
          <li>tie line region corners
          <li>ruler endpoints
        </ul>

        <p>If this operation does not highlight the item you want the
          first time, you may use the <code>Shift+Q</code> shortcut
          again and again to highlight other items located nearby.</p>

      <li><b>Select nearest line/curve</b> (<code>Shift+W</code>)
        moves the mouse pointer to and selects the nearest vertex of
        the nearest ruler or curve.

    </ul>

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<li><b>Jump Up, Down, Left,</b> or <b>Right</b>
(<code>Shift+Up/Down/Left/Right</code> arrow) moves the mouse to the
closest curve in the given direction. For example, in binary
temperature/composition diagrams, <code>Shift+Left</code>
and <code>Shift+Right</code> allow you to see each phase transition
for a fixed temperature, while <code>Shift+Up</code>
and <code>Shift+Down</code> allow you to see each phase transition for
a fixed composition.

<li><b>Step Up, Down, Left,</b> or <b> Right</b>
(<code>Up/Down/Left/Right</code> arrow) moves the mouse in small
increments.

<li><h3 id=ViewPopup>View popup menu</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Zoom in</b> (<code>Control++</code>, press <code>+</code>
    (shift is not needed) while holding down the <code>Control</code>
    key) zooms in by a fixed increment. This is an alternative to
    zooming in by <a href="#DragToZoom">dragging the mouse</a>.

    <li><b>Zoom out</b> (<code>Control+-</code>, press <code>-</code>
    while holding down the <code>Control</code> key)
    (<code>Control-Minus</code>) zooms out by a fixed increment. This
    is an alternative to <a href="#BestFit">Best fit</a>.

    <li><p><b>Center mouse</b> (<code>Control+L</code>) brings the
        part of the diagram under the mouse towards the center of the
        edit window. This has no effect unless the diagram is zoomed
        in.
  </ul>

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<li><p><b id=AddVertex>Add vertex</b> (<code>x</code>, or press the
    left mouse button) starts a new curve if none is selected, or adds
    a new vertex to an existing curve.

<li><p><b id=AddAutopositionVertex>Add auto-positioned vertex</b>
    (<code>Shift+X</code>, or press the left mouse button while
    holding down the Shift key) is the same except that the new point
    will be added <a href="#Autoposition">at the auto-position
    location</a>.

<li><h3 id=AddDecoration>Add decoration</h3>

<ul>

  <li><p><b id=Label>Label</b> (<code>t</code>) adds text or a symbol
      anchored at the current mouse position. A window will open,
      permitting you to choose the text, font size, angle, and anchor
      orientation for the label.</p>

    <p>The standard font size has characters whose height is about 2%
      of the height of binary diagrams and 2% of the length of the
      longest side of ternary diagrams. </p>

    <ul>

      <li>The <code>H2SO4-&gt;H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></code> button
        converts numbers that appear to be meant as subscripts in
        chemical formulas into actual subscripts.

      <li>The <code>Table</code> button converts comma-separated
      values into a table whose columns and rows align. A newline
      starts a new row, and a comma starts a new cell. For example:

        <blockquote>
          1,2&lt;br&gt;<br>
          one,two&lt;br&gt;<br>
          uno,dos&lt;br&gt;<br>
        </blockquote>

        becomes

        <blockquote>
          <table>
            <tr><td style="text-align:right">1&nbsp;<td>2</tr>
            <tr><td style="text-align:right">one&nbsp;<td>two</tr>
            <tr><td style="text-align:right">uno&nbsp;<td>dos</tr>
          </table>
        </blockquote>

        <p>By default, the first column is right-aligned and the other
        columns are left-aligned, but you can change that by removing
        or adding "align=left" or "align=right" to the &lt;td&gt; tags
        created during conversion.

      <li>The nine anchor buttons in the lower right determine whether
        the label will be centered at the anchor or will have a corner
        or center of one side located there. The anchors use the text's
        frame of reference: for example, if the label reads "Foo" and
        the lower right button is selected, then the corner of the F
        will lie closest to the anchor, no matter what text angle is
        selected.

      <li>If you check the box for <b id=LabelWhiteBackground>White label
          background</b>, a white rectangle will be printed behind the
        label. White label backgrounds only obscure decorations in lower
        layers, so you may need to <a href="#Layer">raise the label</a>
        as well.

      <li>If you check the box for <b id=LabelWhiteHoles>White character
          holes</b>, the insides of hollow letters and characters will
        be painted white. This option is mostly useful for symbols,
        and it insures that a hollow circle stands out when plotted
        over a solid line. White character holes only obscure
        decorations in lower layers, so you may need
        to <a href="#Layer">raise the label</a> as well.

      <li>If you check the box for <b>Label border</b>, the label will be
        surrounded by a thin border.

      <li>If you check the box for <b>Compact label</b>, the label
      text wraps to achieve a good compromise between height and
      width.

    </ul>

    <p>If you have a very short label selected, then clicking the left
      mouse button will add another label like it, in the same way
      that clicking the left button will add another point if you have
      a curve selected.

    <p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

  <li><p><b id=Isotherm>Isotherm/Line Label</b> (<code>i</code>)
      creates a label in the middle of the closest line.</p>

  <li><p><b id=Arrowhead>Right Arrowhead</b> (<code>&gt;</code>) draws
    an arrowhead that points at the angle indicated in the math
    window. <b>Left Arrowhead</b> (<code>&lt;</code>) draws an
    arrowhead that points in the opposite direction, press '&lt;'. The
    size of the arrowhead is determined by the line width indicated in
    the math window.</p>

    <p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

  <li><p><b id=Ruler>Ruler</b> creates a ruler or axis. However, you
    must create and select a line segment that marks the ruler's
    endpoints first. If you have done this, a window will open to
    allow you to edit the ruler's properties.</p>

    <p>There is currently no way to automatically generate a ruler that
      displays weight percent values in a mole-percent diagram or vice
      versa. All you can do is convert the entire diagram between the
      two states.</p>

    <p>Rulers in this program display values of a known variable or
      component. You may choose to have the tick labels display the
      basic value (which is the fractional value for components), a
      percentage (100 times the basic value) or 10<sup>value</sup> for
      logarithmic plots. For example, if <code>Si</code> is one of the
      components of your diagram and you select it in the "Create Ruler"
      dialog window's "Display variable/component" selection box, and
      you check the <a href="#RulerPercent">Use percentages in
        labels</a> box, then if there is a label displayed at the position
      where your ruler crosses the 50% Si threshold, the label will
      equal 50.</p>

    <p>If no existing variable has the values you need your ruler to
      display in the positions where your ruler needs them, you may need
      to <a href="#Variable">create a new variable</a>.

    <p>For more information on rulers, press the <b>Help</b> button
      for the Create/Edit Ruler dialog.

  <li>

    <p>To create a <b id=Circle>circle, arc, or ellipse</b>, first
      create and select a curve with between one and four control
      points. Alternatively, draw a <a href="#Rectangle">rectangle or
      square</a>. If you draw a rectangle or square, the figure will
      touch the four midpoints of your rectangle or square. Otherwise
      the figure will touch each of your control points. If you choose
      two points only, they become the diameter of your circle. Three
      points also define a circle. Four points define an ellipse. To
      create an arc, press the 'o' key for a figure with three or more
      control points. Two of those points will become endpoints of the
      arc.</p>

  <li><p><b id=TieLines>Tie Lines</b></p>

    <p>To create a set of tie lines, select the<b>Tie Lines</b>
      option of the <code>Add decoration</code> popup menu and
      follow the instructions in the window that opens. </p>

    <p>Unlike other decorations, you can't just move the endpoints of
    a tie line from one place to another. If you put a tie line in the
    wrong place, delete it and create a new one.</p>

<li><h3 id=Edit>Edit popup menu</h3>

    <ul>

      <li><p><b>Undo</b> (<code>Control+Z</code>) undoes most operations.

      <li><p><b>Redo</b> (<code>Control+Y</code>) redoes the last
          operation that you chose to undo. This is not possible if
          you made other changes since then.

      <li><p><b>Paste</b> (<code>Control+V</code>) pastes into the
          diagram whatever you most recently <a href="#Cut">cut</a>
          or <a href="#Copy">copied</a>.</p>

      <li><p><b>Cut All</b> (<code>Control+A</code>) cuts everything and pastes in in the clipboard.

    </ul>

<li><h3 id=EditSel>Edit selection / Edit nearest item popup menus</h3>

  <p>The commands in the <b>Edit selection</b> menu apply to the
    currently selected item, usually highlighted
    in <span style="color:green;">green</span>. If no item is
    selected, the <b>Edit nearest item</b> menu allows you to apply
    some of these operations to the item closest to the mouse pointer.</p>

    <ul>

      <li><p><b id=Color>Color</b> (<code>r</code>) changes the item's
          color. If the selection is highlighted, you will not see its
          true color until you deselect it. The color you choose
          becomes the default color for new decorations until you
          change it again.

        <p>White decorations may seem to disappear, and curves and
          labels that are filled in white may make items in
          lower <a href="#Layer">layers</a> seem to disappear.</p>

      <li>
        <p><b id=Copy>Copy</b> (<code>Control+C</code>) adds the
        selection to the clipboard.</p>

      <li>
        <p><b id=Cut>Cut</b> (<code>Control+X</code>) erases the
        selection and stores it in the clipboard.</p>

      <li>
        <p><b id=CutRegion>Cut everything in selected region</b>
          (<code>Control+Shift+X</code>) cuts all decorations that are
          entirely contained in that region and adds them to the
          clipboard. You can quickly define a rectangular selection by
          pressing Shift as you begin to drag the mouse.</p>

        <p>This operation has a second purpose when applied to a
          label. It will cut every label that has the same text as
          that label.</p>

      <li><p><b id=Delete>Delete</b> (<code>Delete</code>)
          deletes a single vertex or decoration.</p>

      <li><p><b>Move selection only</b> (<code>Shift+V</code>) moves
          the selected vertex or item to the current mouse position.</p>

        <p>When moving labels that are not anchored in the center, it
          makes a difference whether you select the label's center
          (the green circle is empty) or its anchor (the green circle
          is solid). Even if a label is anchored on the upper left
          corner, for example, a label whose center is moved will end
          up with its center, not the upper-left corner, at the new
          position.</p>

      <li><p><b>Move everything at selected point</b> (<code>v</code>)
          moves the selected vertex or item and all other items at the
          same location.</p>

      <li><p><b>Properties</b> (<code>e</code>) brings up a special
          menu to edit the selected item's properties. Labels, rulers,
          and tie lines may be edited this way.</p>

      <li><p><b>Revert properties to default</b> (<code>d</code>)
          changes the selected item's color, line thickness (if
          applicable), and line style (if applicable) to the current
          default values.</p>

      <li><p><b>Make selection's properties the new default</b>
          (<code>Shift+D</code>) changes the current default values
          for color, line thickness (if applicable), and line style
          (if applicable) to match the selected item.</p>

        <p>Pressing <code>Shift+D</code> on one item and then
          pressing <code>d</code> on others is a quick way to change
          many things to match the first thing.</p>
    </ul>

<li><p>The <b id=Layer>Layer</b> menu determines the order in
    which decorations are printed. Lower layers are printed
    before higher layers -- to put it another way, the lower
    layers form the background for the higher layers. For
    instance, if you have two decorations that intersect, and
    one is solid black while the other is solid red, then the
    intersection will be red if the red decoration is higher or
    black if the black decoration is higher. New decorations are
    initially placed above all old ones.

  <p>Plain black decorations never stand out against a black
    background, regardless of layering, because the "white"
    parts of the decoration are just holes that allow the
    background to show through. To make a label stand out
    against a black background, color the label non-black or
    check <a href="#LabelWhiteBackground">White label
      background</a> or, for data points,
    possibly <a href="#LabelWhiteHoles">White character
      holes</a>. In either case, the label needs to be moved to a
    higher layer than the background before it can be
    visible.</p>

  <p><b>Lower</b> moves the selected or nearest item farther
    into the background, while <b>Raise</b> moves the item
    closer to the foreground. <b>To bottom</b> moves the item
    all the way into the background, and <b>To top</b> moves the
    item all the way into the foreground.</p>

<li><p><b>Copy coordinates to clipboard</b> copies all of the
    coordinate information in the gray status bar at the bottom of the
    Editor screen to the clipboard.</p>

<h2>Drawing common shapes</h2>

<h3 id=Rectangle>Squares and rectangles</h3>

<p>The fastest way to draw a rectangle is to press and hold the shift
key as you begin to drag the mouse, then release the mouse button when
the rectangle has roughly the correct shape. This is the same
procedure as <a href="#DragToZoom">dragging to zoom<'a>, except the
shift key should be down when you begin to hold down the mouse button.
To be more precise, you can draw a rectangle as a 4-point closed
unsmoothed curve:

<ol> 

<li>If necessary, <a href="#Smooth">unselect the <code>Curve/Smooth
  through new points</code> check box</a>. Also, if a curve is already
  selected, press <code>Escape</code> to unselect it.

<li>Add the bottom left corner of the rectangle using any of the
  various mouse positioning methods described elsewhere.

  <p>For all subsequent steps, you should keep the shift key depressed
  to activate auto-positioning.

<li>Move the mouse near the intended bottom right corner.
  Press <code>Shift+left mouse button</code>.

<li>Move the mouse near the intended upper right corner. If you are
  making a square (and holding down the Shift key as recommended), you
  should see the outline turn olive when you are near the right spot.
  Press <code>Shift+left mouse button</code>.

<li>Let go of the Shift key for a moment
  and <a href=#ToggleClosure>press <code>o</code></a> to make a closed
  polygon.

<li>Move the mouse near the intended upper left corner and
  press <code>Shift+left mouse button</code> when the outline turns
  olive colored.

</ol>

You can use a similar process to make isoceles or equilateral triangles.

<h3 id=Parallel>Parallel lines</h3>

<p>To create vertical or horizontal lines, just use the Shift key for
auto-positioning. To create other parallel lines:</p>

<ol>

<li>Add the first vertex of the line using one of the procedures
already described. Let the new vertex remain selected.

<li>Press <code>w</code> to select the line you want the new line to
  be parallel to. This will enter the slope of that line in the math
  window so auto-position will prefer points at the given slope with
  respect to your first vertex.

<li>Move the mouse near the other intended endpoint and
  press <code>Shift+left mouse button</code>.

</ol>
