<p>Rulers are diagram decorations that display regularly spaced tick
  marks and/or labels. Rulers may contain one size of tick mark or two
  different sizes ("big ticks" and "small ticks").

<p><b id=Labels>Tick labels</b>: Select where and if number labels are
  displayed on the ruler. Labels are placed next adjacent to where big
  ticks appear (or would appear, if tick marks are not enabled).

<p><b id=Display>Display variable/component</b>: Select the variable
  or diagram component whose value this ruler represents. The value of
  that variable at a given position determines the ruler's value at
  that position as well. If no existing variable has the values you
  need your ruler to display in the positions where your ruler needs
  them, you may need to create a new variable (see the main PED Editor
  help file).

<p><b id=Angle>Label angle with respect to axis</b>: This setting
  determines whether the label text is horizontal, vertical, or even
  backwards. A zero degree angle means that the label text is parallel
  to the ruler axis (which does not mean that the label text is
  horizontal unless the ruler itself is horizontal). Positive angles
  are clockwise with respect to that. If you leave the label angle at
  its original setting, the label text will initially be horizontal.

<p><b id=WhiteSpace>Minimum white space between tick labels, in
    multiples of label height</b>: If you do not explicitly set the
    tick step size, the distance between big ticks will be set at
    least high enough that the labels would not overlap. (That minimum
    distance applies even if you
    choose <b>Tick&nbsp;labels:&nbsp;None</b>.) You can increase the
    separation between labels by entering larger values here.
    The actual tick step will be a round number large enough to exceed
    this minimum, so, depending on circumstances, a slight change to
    this value may not affect the actual tick step.

<p>A minimum white space value of 0 tends to produce labels that are
    close together. A value of 3 produces labels that are more widely
    spaced.

<p><b id=Ticks>Left/right/top/bottom-side tick marks</b>: Check to
  display tick marks on the given side of the axis. Checking both
  boxes causes tick marks to extend from both sides.

<p><b id=VTicks>V-shaped tick marks</b> are used mainly for ternary
  diagrams. Check this box if you need them.

<p><b id=RulerPercent>Use percentages in labels</b>: If this box is
  checked, then the ruler displays percentage values, or 100 times the
  fraction value. A tick mark for a variable whose value at that
  position is displayed as 50% or 0.5 in the gray status bar at the
  bottom of the edit window will be labeled display as either 50 or
  0.5, depending on whether this box is checked or not.

<p><b id=Pow10>Display 10<sup>x</sup> in labels</b>: Check this box
  for logarithmic plots where you wish the labels to be powers of 10
  instead logarithms -- for instance, 1, 10, and 100 instead of 0, 1,
  and 2.

<p><b id=Arrows>Top/bottom/left/right arrow</b>: Check this box to add
  an arrow at the given ruler endpoint.

<p><b id=SuppressTick>Suppress top/bottom/left/right tick</b>: Check
  this box to suppress any tick mark that might otherwise appear at
  the given ruler endpoint.

<p><b id=SuppressLabel>Suppress top/bottom/left/right label</b>: Check
  this box to suppress any label that might otherwise appear at the
  given ruler endpoint.

<p>When drawing two rulers that cross in the middle, such as for a
  Cartesian graph that displays four quadrants for the negative and
  positive X and Y values, there may be difficulties where the rulers
  cross (typically at the origin). The X-axis label at x=0 will
  typically be overstruck by the Y-axis, and the Y-axis label at y=0
  will typically be overstruck by the X-axis. A solution to that is to
  replace each individual ruler with two separate ones that lie along
  the same line and meet at the origin, so there are 4 rulers that
  each have one endpoint at the origin, and to suppress the labels and
  ticks for each ruler at that end.

<p><b id=SuppressSmallTicks>Suppress small ticks</b>: Check this to
  prevent all small tick marks from being displayed.

<p><b id=BigStepSize>Big tick step size (optional)</b>: You may specify what the
  difference between big ticks should be or leave this blank to allow
  the program to choose a reasonable value. On its own, the program
  will always choose values that are 1, 2, or 5 times a power of 10.

<p><b id=SmallStepSize>Small tick step size (optional)</b>: You may
  specify what the difference between big ticks should be or leave
  this blank to allow the program to choose a reasonable value
  (normally the largest round number that divides the big tick step
  size).

<p><b id=MinTick>Minimum/maximum tick value (optional)</b>: Usually
  you want the ticks to extend the length of the ruler, possibly
  leaving out the start or endpoints. In that case, leave this blank.
  But if you want to explicitly specify the minimum and maximum tick
  values, you may do so here.
