<h1>PED Edit Window Help</h1>

<p><i>Please note that this file will open using the default browser
you have chosen for your computer, either full- or partial-screen,
according to its last usage. If the last view was not full screen, the
PED Figure Search interface will remain partially visible
underneath.</i>

<p><i>Note</i>: This help file only describes the functions most
likely to be useful to viewers of PED diagrams. For access to advanced
features, select the <code>Properties</code> menu and check the box
next to <code>Show Editing Options</code>. Afterwards, you can re-open
the Help file to obtain a more complete description of these features
as well as descriptions of additional features.

<p>The PED (Phase Equilibria Diagram) Editor was written by Eric
Boesch to digitize phase diagrams for the PED Data Center. The editor
can also be used for general scientifc drawing and two-dimensional
visualization. The latest version is available for downloading as
freeware with some restrictions;
see <a href="http://www.nist.gov/srd/nist31.cfm">http://www.nist.gov/srd/nist31.cfm</a>.

<p>Some features may be accessed through the menu bar along the top
edge of the Viewer screen, while others are accessed through a menu
that is raised by pressing the right mouse button (if your mouse does
not have a right button, use whatever control you normally use to
raise popup menus). These functions (and their keyboard shortcuts) are
described below.

<h2><a id="File">File</a></h2>

<h3>New Diagram</h3>

<p>Create a new diagram from scratch. If you wish to digitize a
scanned image of an existing diagram, use the
<a href="#open"><code>File/Open</code></a> option instead.</p>

<p>You are presented with a selection of diagram types. Select the
"Binary or Cartesian" type for Cartesian graphs, binary diagrams,
quaternary diagrams, and all other diagrams based on a rectangular
graph. For ternary diagrams, select one of the "Ternary" subtypes. If
none of the given categories apply, select the "Free-form" type to
start with a blank page.

<h3><a id="open">Open</a></h3>

<p>Open either an image file saved in GIF, JPEG, or PNG format or a
diagram that was previously saved in this program's native PED
format.</p>

<p>If you open an image file, a window will open that allows you to
select the boundary of a diagram within that image and then create a
new diagram traced from the old one. That window has its own Help menu
option which provides more information.</p>

<h3>Save as PDF</h3>

<p>Save an image of the diagram. Diagrams saved as PDF stay sharp at
higher magnification.

<h3>Save as PNG</h3>
<h3>Save as GIF</h3>
<h3>Save as JPEG</h3>

<p>Save an image of the diagram. Diagrams saved in these pixelated
formats do not stay sharp at higher magnification.

<h3>Print</h3>

<p>Print the diagram. The image will be scaled so that its margins
just fit on the sheet.

<h3>Next File</h3>

<p>Switch to the next selected diagram, if any. This option is only
enabled if you opened multiple files at once.

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<h2><a id="Position">Position</a></h2>

<p>This menu includes functions to move the mouse pointer within the diagram.

<h3 id=Autoposition>Auto-positioning</h3>

<p>Holding the shift key down while moving the mouse causes the mouse
to be attracted to nearby curves and points of special interest.

<ul>

<li><b><a id="Enter">Enter coordinates</a></b> (<code>Enter</code>)
allows you to type in the coordinates you would like the mouse to move
to. If you enter coordinates that are off the diagram page, the page
will be enlarged to put the position on its edge.

<li><p><b>Jump to selection</b> (<code>j</code>) moves the mouse
pointer to the currently selected item, if an item is
selected.</p></li>

</ul>

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<h2><a id=Properties>Properties</a></h2>

<ul>

<li><p>Check the <b>Show editing options</b> box to reveal diagram
editing options and less commonly used features.

</ul>

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<h2><a id=Digitize>Digitize</a></h2>

<ul>

<li><p><b>Export text to clipboard</b>: Export all labels, key values,
tags, and diagram components to the clipboard, with duplicates and
HTML tags removed. Each entry is terminated by a newline. If you
selected a label, then only that label is exported.

<li><p><b>Export selected curve or label's coordinates</b>: You must
already have selected a <a href="#SelectCurve">curve</a>
or <a href="#SelectPoint">label or data point</a>. If you selected a
curve, this will export the coordinates of all of its control points
to a file or to the clipboard. If you selected a label or data point,
this will export the coordinates of all similar labels or data points.

<li><p><b>Export all curve and label coordinates</b>: Export the
coordinates of all curve control points and all labels to a file or to
the clipboard. Coordinates belonging to a single curve and labels that
share the same text are grouped together; groups are separated from
each other by empty lines or comments.

<p>Checking the <code>Add comments</code> box will make the output
easier to interpret but may make it harder to import the data into
other programs. Comments begin with the sharp sign (#).

</ul>

<h3>Digitization format</h3>

<p>All data imported from or exported to a file use the UTF-8
character encoding. If you export coordinates without comments,
however, the output file will contain ASCII characters only, so most
programs capable of reading plain text will be able to read and
display the file. (Do not, however, use Windows Notepad. Use WordPad
instead.)

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<h2><a id=Chemistry>Chemistry</a></h2>

<ul>

<li><p><b>Proportions/Convert to [weight/mole] fraction</b>: Transform
the entire diagram between weight and mole fraction values.

<p>There is no guarantee that every point on every curve of the
diagram will be correct after you perform a conversion, and points
outside the diagram may not line up very well at all. The diagram may
look funny, especially if there is a wide divergence between the mole
and weight percents. Also, text angles may be wrong after conversion.

<li><p><b>Formula to mole/weight fraction</b> (also available by
pressing the <code>%</code> key, that is <code>Shift+5</code> on US
keyboards): Enter a chemical formula, and the molecular weight of the
that formula and its representation in the Hill system will be
displayed. You can also use this to check whether the program can
parse the expression for use as a diagram component.

<p>If the diagram components are properly defined and the formula
corresponds to a point inside the diagram, you may press the <b>Locate
compound in diagram</b> button to go there. A final step might be
to <a href="#Label">create a label</a> at that point. In Microsoft
Windows, you can press <code>Control-V</code> to paste your formula
into the text window.

<li><p><b>Swap components</b> exchanges the position of the left and
right components in binary diagrams. For ternary diagrams, any pair of
components may be swapped, but the diagram may look odd after swapping
the top component. All three components can be reordered using
successive swaps.

</ul>

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<h2><a id=View>View</a></h2>

<p><a id=DragToZoom>Usually, the easiest way to zoom in is to press
the left button and drag the mouse until a red zoom rectangle
forms.</a>

<p>Once you have zoomed in, you can use <b id=BestFit>Best fit</b>
(<code>Control+B</code>) to zoom all the way back out again.

<p>The <b>Show slope window</b> checkbox can be used to close or
reopen the slope window, which shows the slope of the second principal
variable with respect to the first one at the most recently selected
point on a curve.

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<h2><a id="Popup">Popup Menu</a></h2>

<p>To open the popup menu, press the right mouse button while the
mouse is inside the diagram. If you hold down the <code>Shift</code>
key as you do this, the operation will apply
to <a href="#Autoposition">the nearest point of special interest</a>.
Otherwise, the operation will apply to the current mouse position.

<ul>

<li>If you previously <a href="#SelectPoint">selected an item</a>
(usually highlighted in <span style="color:green;">green</span>),
then <b>Deselect</b> (<code>Escape</code>) will un-highlight the item.

<li><h3 id=PositionPopup>Position popup menu</h3>

    <ul>

      <li><b>Auto-position</b> moves the mouse
      to <a href="#Autoposition">the nearest point of special
      interest</a>.

      <li><b id=SelectPoint>Select nearest point</b>
        (<code>Shift+Q</code>) moves the mouse to decoration anchors
        and curve vertexes, including

        <ul>
          <li>arrows
          <li>curve vertex
          <li>label anchors and label centers
          <li>tie line region corners
          <li>ruler endpoints
        </ul>

        <p>If this operation does not highlight the item you want the
          first time, you may use the <code>Shift+Q</code> shortcut
          again and again to highlight other items located nearby.</p>

      <li><b>Select nearest line/curve</b> (<code>Shift+W</code>)
        moves the mouse pointer to and selects the nearest vertex of
        the nearest ruler or curve.

    </ul>

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<li><b>Jump Up, Down, Left,</b> or <b>Right</b>
(<code>Shift+Up/Down/Left/Right</code> arrow) moves the mouse to the
closest curve in the given direction. For example, in binary
temperature/composition diagrams, <code>Shift+Left</code>
and <code>Shift+Right</code> allow you to see each phase transition
for a fixed temperature, while <code>Shift+Up</code>
and <code>Shift+Down</code> allow you to see each phase transition for
a fixed composition.

<li><b>Step Up, Down, Left,</b> or <b> Right</b>
(<code>Up/Down/Left/Right</code> arrow) moves the mouse in small
increments.

<li><h3>View popup menu</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Zoom in</b> (<code>Control++</code>, press <code>+</code>
    (shift is not needed) while holding down the <code>Control</code>
    key) zooms in by a fixed increment. This is an alternative to
    zooming in by <a href="#DragToZoom">dragging the mouse</a>.

    <li><b>Zoom out</b> (<code>Control+-</code>, press <code>-</code>
    while holding down the <code>Control</code> key)
    (<code>Control-Minus</code>) zooms out by a fixed increment. This
    is an alternative to <a href="#BestFit">Best fit</a>.

    <li><p><b>Center mouse</b> (<code>Control+L</code>) brings the
        part of the diagram under the mouse towards the center of the
        edit window. This has no effectd unless the diagram is zoomed
        in.
  </ul>

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a></p>

<li><p><b>Copy coordinates to clipboard</b> copies all of the
    coordinate information in the gray status bar at the bottom of the
    Editor screen to the clipboard.</p>

</ul>
