<h1>PED Viewer Help</h1>

<p><i>Note</i>: This help file only describes the functions most
likely to be useful to viewers of PED diagrams. For access to advanced
features, select the <code>Properties</code> menu and check the box
next to <code>Show Editing Options</code>. Afterwards, you can re-open
the Help file to obtain a more complete description of these features
as well as descriptions of additional features.

<h2>File Menu</h2>

<h3>Save as PDF</h3>

<h3>Save as PNG</h3>

<p>Save an image of the diagram. Diagrams saved as PDF tend to be of
higher quality than diagrams saved as PNG.

<h3>Print</h3>

<p>Print the diagram. The image will be scaled so that its margins
just fit on the sheet.

<h2>Position Menu</h2>

<p>In addition to moving the mouse pointer, the following commands are
available for diagram positioning:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Nearest point</b> (<code>q</code>) moves the mouse to the
nearest point of special interest such as curve and line intersections
and endpoints and label and data point locations.

<li><b>Nearest line/curve</b> (<code>w</code>) moves the mouse to the
the nearest point on any ruler or curve.

<li><b>Enter coordinates</b> (<code>Enter</code>) allows you to type
in the coordinates you would like the mouse to move to.</li>

</ul>

<p>Holding the shift key down while moving the mouse will cause the
mouse to be attracted to nearby curves and points of special
interest.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Digitize Menu</h2>

<ul>

<p>Files saved during export use the UTF-8 character encoding.</p>

<li><p><b>Export all text</b>: Export all labels, key values, tags,
and diagram components, with duplicates removed. Each entry is
terminated by a newline.

<li><p><b>Export all curve and label coordinates</b>: Export the
coordinates of all curve control points and all labels. Coordinates
belonging to a single curve and labels that share the same text are
grouped together; groups are separated from each other by empty lines
or comments.

<p>Checking the <code>Add comments</code> box will make the output
easier to interpret but may make it harder to import the data into
other programs. Comments begin with the sharp sign (#).

<li>Press <code>Control+Shift+S</code> to copy the text in the gray
status bar at the bottom of the edit window to the clipboard.

</ul>

<h2>Chemistry Menu</h2>

<ul>

<li><p><b>Proportions/Convert to [weight/mole] fraction</b>: Transform
the diagram between weight and mole fraction values.

<p>There is no guarantee that every point on every curve of the
diagram will be correct after you perform a conversion, and points
outside the diagram may not line up very well at all. The diagram may
look funny, especially if there is a wide divergence between the mole
and weight percents.

<li><p><b>Formula to mole/weight fraction</b> (also available by
pressing the <code>%</code> key, that is (on US
keyboards) <code>Shift+5</code>): Enter a chemical formula, and the
mouse will move to the position in the diagram that that formula
corresponds to.

<li><p><b>Copy all formulas to clipboard</b>: Copy all unique formulas
in the diagram to the clipboard in alphabetical order, one per line.

</ul>

<h2>View Menu</h2>

<p>To zoom in, press the left button and drag the mouse until a red
rectangle forms. Press <code>Control+B</code> (best fit) to exactly
fill the edit window with the diagram.

<p>Alternatively, you can press '-' to zoom out and '+' to zoom in.

<p><b>Center mouse</b> (<code>Control+L</code>) brings the part of the
diagram under the mouse towards the center of the edit window. (The
mouse may not end up in the center if that would bring empty space into view.)
