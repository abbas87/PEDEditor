<p>The diagram selection window is used to identify the position of a
diagram within an image. Click on points within the image to identify
the diagram, then press Enter (or select the menu option
<u>E</u>dit/<u>S</u>election Complete) to select the region outlined
in <font color="green">green</font> and return to the diagram edit
window. If no region is outlined in green, click on more points to
complete the selection.</p>

<p>The green outline (if present) shows the current selection. The
<font color="red">red</font> outline (if present) shows the selection
that would result from clicking on the mouse's present location.</p>

<p>The arrow keys move the most recently added cropping point one
pixel in any direction.</p>

<p>The <b>delete</b> key deletes the last cropping point added.</p>

<p>For binary diagrams, you may click on zero points to select the
entire image, two points to select a rectangle, three points to select
a rotated rectangle, or four points to select every vertex of the
rectangle (for example, for hand-drawn diagrams whose sides are not
quite parallel).</p>

<p>For most ternary diagrams, you may either click on two points to
select an equilateral triangle or on three points to select all three
vertices.</p>

<p>For partial ternary diagrams with their tops missing, you must
select all four vertices of a region that is intended to appear
trapezoidal in the final diagram. If the final diagram is not meant to
appear as a trapezoid (because one side is meant to be longer than the
other), then extend the shorter size to select a trapezoidal region
anyway, and shorten that side later during editing.</p>

<p>The image's orientation must already be approximately correct,
instead of upside down or sideways. If the image's orientation is off
by 45&deg; or more, you may need to correct that using an external
tool (such as GIMP) before opening the image in the selection
window.</p>
