<p>The cropping window is used to identify the position of a binary or
ternary phase equilibrium diagram within a scanned page. Open an image
file using <u>F</u>ile/<u>O</u>pen, click on three or four points to
identify the diagram boundary, and then press Enter (or select the
menu option <u>E</u>dit/<u>C</u>rop) when finished.</p>

<p>Three points that approximate an equilateral triangle select a
ternary diagram.</p>

<p>Three points that do not approximate an equilateral triangle select
a rectangle for a binary diagram.</p>

<p>Four points select an arbitrary quadrilateral for a binary diagram.
The fourth point may be needed for hand-drawn diagrams whose sides are
not quite parallel.</p>

<p>The <font color="green">green</font> outline (if present) shows the
currently selected cropping region. The <font color="red">red</font>
outline (if present) shows the cropping region that would result from
adding the point under the mouse.</p>

<p>The arrow keys move the most recently added cropping point one
pixel in any direction.</p>

<p>The <b>delete</b> key deletes the last cropping point added.</p>

<p>It is assumed that the scanned page is already oriented
approximately correctly. If that is not the case -- if the diagram is
transposed or the page was scanned sideways, for example -- then you
will need to correct that using an external tool before opening the
image in the cropping window.</p>
