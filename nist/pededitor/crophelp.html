<p>The diagram selection window is used to identify the position of a
diagram within an image. Click on points within the image to identify
the diagram boundary, and then press Enter (or select the menu option
<u>E</u>dit/<u>C</u>rop) when finished to select the region outlined
in <font color="green">green</font>. If no region is outlined in
green, then you must first click on more points.</p>

<p>The green outline (if present) shows the current selection. The
<font color="red">red</font> outline (if present) shows the selection
that would result from clicking on the mouse's present location.</p>

<p>The arrow keys move the most recently added cropping point one
pixel in any direction.</p>

<p>The <b>delete</b> key deletes the last cropping point added.</p>

<p>For binary diagrams, you may click on zero points to select the
entire image, two points to select a rectangle, three points to select
a rotated rectangle, or four points to select every vertex of the
rectangle (for example, for hand-drawn diagrams whose sides are not
quite parallel).</p>

<p>For most ternary diagrams, you may click on two points to select an
equilateral triangle or three points to select each vertex of a
triangle.</p>

<p>For partial ternary diagrams with their tops missing, you must
select all four vertices of a trapezoidal region. If the left and
right sides of the partial ternary are not meant to appear even, then
extend the shorter side of your selection until the two sides are even.</p>

<p>The image's orientation must already be approximately correct,
instead of upside down or sideways. If the image's orientation is off
by 45&deg; or more, you may need to correct that using an external
tool (such as GIMP) before opening the image in the selection
window.</p>
