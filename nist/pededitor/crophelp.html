<h1>PED Diagram Selection Window Help</h1>

<p>Use this window to identify the corners of a diagram within an
image. Click on points within the image to identify the diagram, then
press Enter (or select the menu option
<u>E</u>dit/<u>S</u>election Complete) to select the region outlined
in <span style="color:green;">green</span> and return to the diagram
edit window. If no region is outlined in green, click on more points
to complete the selection.

<p>The green outline (if present) shows the current selection. The
<span style="color: red;">red</span> outline (if present) shows the
selection that would result from clicking on the mouse's present
location.

<p>The arrow keys move the most recently added diagram corner one
pixel in any direction.

<p>The <b>Delete</b> key deletes the last corner added.

<p>For binary diagrams, you may click on zero points to select the
entire image, two points to select a rectangle, three points to select
a rotated rectangle, or four points to select every vertex of the
rectangle (for example, for hand-drawn diagrams whose sides are not
quite parallel).

<p>For most ternary diagrams, you may either click on two points to
select an equilateral triangle or on three points to select some other
kind of triangle.

<p>For partial ternary diagrams missing the top corner, you must
select all four vertices of a region that is intended to appear
trapezoidal in the final diagram. If the final diagram is not meant to
appear as a trapezoid (because one side is meant to be longer than the
other), then extend the shorter size to select a trapezoidal region
anyway, and shorten that side later during editing.

<p>The image's orientation must already be approximately correct,
instead of upside down or sideways. If the image's orientation is off
by 45&deg; or more, you may need to correct that using an external
tool such as GIMP or MS-Paint before opening the image in the
selection window.
