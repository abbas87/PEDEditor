<h1>PED Viewer Help</h1>

<p>Some boilerplate about finding the Editor at 
<a href="http://www.nist.gov/srd/nist31.cfm">the NIST site</a>.

<h2>File Menu</h2>

<h3>Save as PDF</h3>

<h3>Save as PNG</h3>

<p>Save an image of the diagram. This can be done for all diagrams,
including old ones for which PDF-format output was not previously
available. Diagrams saved as PDF stay sharp at high magnifications,
but diagrams saved as PNG do not.

<h3>Print</h3>

<p>Print the diagram. The image will be scaled so that its margins
just fit on the sheet.

<h2>Position Menu</h2>

<p>In addition to moving the mouse pointer, the following commands are
available for diagram positioning:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Select nearest point</b> (<code>Shift+Q</code>) moves the mouse
to the nearest point of special interest such as curve intersections,
curve endpoints, and label and data point locations.

<li><b>Select nearest line/curve</b> (<code>Shift+W</code>) moves the
mouse to the the nearest point on any ruler or curve.

<li><b>Enter coordinates</b> (<code>Enter</code>) allows you to type
in the coordinates you would like the mouse to move to.</li>

</ul>

<p>Holding the shift key down while moving the mouse will cause the
mouse to be attracted to nearby curves and points of special
interest.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Digitize Menu</h2>

<ul>

<p>Files saved during export use the UTF-8 character encoding.</p>

<li><p><b>Export selected curve or label's coordinates</b>: Export the
coordinates of all curve control points and all labels to a file or to
the clipboard. Coordinates

<li><p><b>Export all curve and label coordinates</b>: Export the
coordinates of all curve control points and all labels to a file or to the clipboard. Coordinates
belonging to a single curve and labels that share the same text are
grouped together; groups are separated from each other by empty lines
or comments.

<p>Checking the <code>Add comments</code> box will make the output
easier to interpret but may make it harder to import the data into
other programs. Comments begin with the sharp sign (#).

<li>Press <code>Control+Shift+S</code> to copy the text in the gray
status bar at the bottom of the edit window to the clipboard.

</ul>

<h2>Chemistry Menu</h2>

<ul>

<li><p><b>Proportions/Convert to [weight/mole] fraction</b>: Transform
the diagram between weight and mole fraction values.

<p>This function works only for binary or ternary diagrams whose
diagram components and extreme values have been entered correctly.

<li><p><b>Formula to mole/weight fraction</b> (also available by
pressing the <code>%</code> key, that is (on US
keyboards) <code>Shift+5</code>): Enter a chemical formula, and the
mouse will move to the position in the diagram that that formula
corresponds to.

</ul>

<h2>View Menu</h2>

<p>To zoom in, press the left button and drag the mouse until a red
rectangle forms. Press <code>Control+B</code> (best fit) to exactly
fill the edit window with the diagram.

<p><b>Center mouse</b> (<code>Control+L</code>) brings the part of the
diagram under the mouse towards the center of the edit window. (The
mouse may not end up in the center if that would bring empty space into view.)

<p><b>Show slope window</b> If checked, opens a window displaying the
angle in screen coordinates and slope in principal coordinates (y/x
for binary diagrams, top component over right compoentn for ternary
diagrams) at the most recently selected location in the diagram.

<h2>Features Modified or Removed Since Version 3.4</h2>

<ul>

<li><b>Zoom out</b>: Use <code>Control+B</code> or <code>View/Best Fit</code>.

<li><b>Curve Follow</b>: Replaced by <i>Select nearest line/curve</i>
(<code>Shift+W</code>), though in some cases <i>Select nearest
point</i> (<code>Shift+Q</code>) is more appropriate. You can use the
arrow keys to move the mouse a small distance further along the curve
and then press <code>Shift+W</code> again.

<li><b>Lever Rule, Overlay, Reflection, and Rotate Axes</b>: These
features are no longer available with version 4.0.

<li><p><b>Mole-to-Weight %</b> and <b>Weight-to-Mole %</b>: For binary
and ternary diagrams whose components have been entered as formulas
and whose axes are set up correctly, the gray status bar at the bottom
of the viewer displays both mole and weight percent at all times for
the chosen location. Converting a diagram from one form to the other
is a one-step operation. For other kinds of diagrams, these features
are not available
