<h1 id="top">PED Viewer Help</h1>

<p><i>Please note that this file will open using the default browser
you have chosen for your computer, either full- or partial-screen,
according to its last usage. If the last view was not full screen, the
PED Figure Search interface will remain partially visible
underneath.</i>

<p>The PED (Phase Equilibria Diagram) Viewer is a component of the PED
Editor software package written by Eric Boesch to digitize phase
diagrams for the PED Data Center. The full version of the PED Editor
is available for downloading as freeware with some restrictions;
see <a href="http://www.nist.gov/srd/nist31.cfm">http://www.nist.gov/srd/nist31.cfm</a>.

<p>Some features may be accessed through the menu bar along the top
edge of the Viewer screen, while others are accessed through a menu
that is raised by pressing the right mouse button. These functions
(and their keyboard shortcuts) are described below.

<h2><a id="File">File</a></h2>

<h3>Open</h3>

<p>Load a <code>.PEDV</code> file manually.</p>

<p>Many users will never need to use this option. However, some of you
  may have system configurations that prevent the PED Viewer from
  opening automatically when you click or download <code>.PEDV</code>
  files. Your IT specialist may be able to help you resolve such
  problems, but they should not prevent you from using the program.

<h3>Save as PDF</h3>

<p>Save an image of the diagram. Diagrams saved as PDF stay sharp at
higher magnification.

<h3>Save as PNG</h3>
<h3>Save as GIF</h3>
<h3>Save as JPEG</h3>

<p>Save an image of the diagram. Diagrams saved in these formats do
not stay sharp at higher magnification.

<h3>Print</h3>

<p>Print the diagram. The image will be scaled so that its margins
just fit on the sheet.

<h3>Exit</h3>

<p>Closes the Viewer screen.

<h3>Exit all</h3>

<p>Closes all Viewer screens at once.

<h2><a id="Position">Position</a></h2>

<ul>

<li><b><a id="Enter">Enter coordinates</a></b> (<code>Enter</code>) allows you to type
in the coordinates you would like the mouse to move to.

</ul>

<p>Holding the shift key down while moving the mouse will cause the
mouse to be attracted to nearby curves and points of special
interest.</p>

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<h2><a id="Digitize">Digitize</a></h2>

<p>Files saved during export use the UTF-8 character encoding.</p>

<ul>

<li><p><b>Export selected curve or label's coordinates</b>: You must
already have selected a <a href="#SelectCurve">curve</a>
or <a href="#SelectPoint">label or data point</a>. If you selected a
curve, this will export the coordinates of all of its control points
to a file or to the clipboard. If you selected a label or data point,
this will export the coordinates of all similar labels or data points.

<li><p><b>Export all curve and label coordinates</b>: Export the
coordinates of all curve control points and all labels to a file or to
the clipboard. Coordinates belonging to a single curve and labels that
share the same text are grouped together; groups are separated from
each other by empty lines or comments.

<p>Checking the <code>Include comments in output</code> box will make
the output easier to interpret but may make it harder to import the
data into other programs. Comments begin with the sharp sign (#).

</ul>

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<h2><a id="Chemistry">Chemistry</a></h2>

<ul>

<li><p><b>Proportions/Convert to [weight/mole] fraction</b>: Transform
the diagram between weight and mole fraction values.

<p>This function works only for binary or ternary diagrams whose
diagram components and extreme values have been entered correctly
(verify by hovering over each diagram component and checking the
accuracy of the values in the gray status bar).

<li><p><b>Formula to mole/weight fraction</b> (also available by
pressing the <code>%</code> key, that is (on US
keyboards) <code>Shift+5</code>): Enter a chemical formula, and the
mouse will move to the position in the diagram that that formula
corresponds to.

<li><p><b id=Swap>Swap components</b> exchanges the position of the left and
right components in binary diagrams. For ternary diagrams, any pair of
components may be swapped, but the diagram may look odd after swapping
the top component. All three components can be reordered using
successive swaps.

</ul>

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<h2><a id="View">View</a></h2>

<p><b><a id="Zoom">Zoom in</a></b>: Press and hold the left mouse
button and drag down and to the right to open a red string box. When
the mouse is released the area in the box will be enlarged.

<p><b>Best Fit</b> (<code>Control+B</code>), after re-sizing the
Viewer window (by dragging the lower right corner), will exactly fill
the Viewer window with the diagram. This is also how you <b>zoom
out</b>.

<p><b>Show slope window</b>: If checked, opens a window displaying the
angle in screen coordinates and slope in principal coordinates (y/x
for binary diagrams, top component over right component for ternary
diagrams) at the most recently selected location in the diagram.

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<h2><a id="Popup">Popup Menu</a></h2>

<p>To open the popup menu, press the right mouse button while the
mouse is inside the diagram. If you hold down the <code>Shift</code>
key as you do this, the operation will apply to the nearest point of
special interest. Otherwise, the operation will apply to the current
mouse position.</p>

<ul>

<li>If you previously chose <a href="#SelectCurve">Select nearest
line/curve</a> or <a href="#SelectPoint">Select nearest key
point</a>, <b>Deselect</b> (<code>Escape</code>) unselects the
item.</li>

<li><b>Jump Up, Down, Left, or Right</b>
(<code>Shift+Up/Down/Left/Right</code> arrow) moves the mouse to the
closest curve in the given direction. For example, in binary
temperature/composition diagrams, repeated use
of <code>Shift+Left</code> and <code>Shift+Right</code> allows you to
see each phase transition for a fixed temperature,
while <code>Shift+Up</code> and <code>Shift+Down</code> allow you to
see each phase transition for a fixed composition.

<li><b>Step Up, Down, Left, or Right</b>
(<code>Up/Down/Left/Right</code> arrow) moves the mouse in small
increments.

<li><b><a id="SelectPoint">Select nearest key point</a></b>
(<code>Shift+Q</code>) moves the mouse to the nearest point of special
interest such as curve intersections, curve endpoints, and label and
data point locations.

<li><b><a id="SelectCurve">Select nearest line/curve</a></b> (<code>Shift+W</code>) moves the
mouse to the nearest point on any ruler or curve.

<li><b>Copy coordinates to clipboard</b> copies the coordinate
information in the gray status bar at the bottom of the Viewer screen
to the clipboard.

</ul>

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<h2><a id="Follow">Curve Follow</a></h2>

Replaced by <a href="#SelectCurve">Select nearest line/curve</a>
(<code>Shift+W</code>), though in some
cases <a href="#SelectPoint">Select nearest key point</a>
(<code>Shift+Q</code>) is more appropriate. You can use the arrow keys
to move the mouse a small distance further along the curve and then
press <code>Shift+W</code> again.

<p><a href="#Top">Return to top</a>

<h2><a id="Mole">Mole/Weight % Readout</a></h2>

<p>For binary and ternary diagrams whose components have been entered
as formulas and whose axes are set up correctly, the gray status bar
at the bottom of the viewer displays both mole and weight percent (as
mol%/wt%, even if the diagram units are wt%) at all times for the
mouse position. Converting a diagram from one form to the other is a
one-step operation using the
<b>Chemistry</b> menu (<b>Proportions</b>). For other kinds of
diagrams, these features are not available.

<h2><a id="Lever">Lever Rule</a></h2>

<p>This feature is no longer available with version 4.1. However, you
can achieve a similar effect with the following procedure:

<ol>

<li>Select a position in the diagram using the mouse or
the <a href="#Enter">Enter Coordinates</a> command.

<li>Press <code>Shift+Left Arrow</code> to jump to the phase
transition on the left, then write down the mole percent concentration
given in the gray status bar at the bottom of the diagram.

<li>Press <code>Shift+Right Arrow</code> to jump to the phase
transition on the right, then write down the given mole percent
concentration.

<li>Use a calculator to divide the distance from the phase transition
on the left to your original point by the distance between the left
and right phase transitions.

</ol>

<h2><a id="Uninstalling">Uninstalling the program</a></h2>

<p>This program uses Java Web Start. To uninstall a Java Web Start
  program in Windows 7, use the following procedure. The details may
  vary depending on your operating system and the version of Java you
  are running.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Java Control Panel.

    <p>Under Windows 7, you can locate the Java control panel by
    opening the (regular Windows) Control Panel, which is one of the
    options listed in the right side of the start menu, then entering
    Java in "Search Control Panel", and clicking on the result.</p>

  <li>From the "General" Tab, under "Temporary Internet Files", press
    the "View..." button. This should open the Java Cache Viewer.

  <li>One of the applications listed should be the Phase Equilibria
  Diagram Viewer. Click on it and press the red X to delete.
