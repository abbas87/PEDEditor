<p>Except as noted, these libraries' source files remain unmodified.
Libraries have been repackaged only to simplify compliance with Java
JAR signing requirements.

<h2>Obtaining and using the source code</h2>

<p>The source code to both the PED Editor and the PED Viewer is
included in the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/srd/ped-editor.cfm">JAR
file</a> for this product. You can use the <code>jar</code> utility,
which is included in Oracle's Java Software Development Kit, to
extract the contents of the JAR file for inspection. The contents of a
JAR file can also be extracted using other utilities that handle ZIP
files, because a JAR file is a kind of ZIP file.

<p>Most of the PED Editor Java source code that does not belong to
third-party libraries is in the public domain. Some source code
requires direct or indirect use of the iText library, and the source
and byte code for those files are subject to
the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">AGPL</a>.
Comments at the top of each source code file indicates which is which.
Programmers who do not wish to be subject to the AGPL may request a
copy of the PED Editor that does not use iText or support PDF format.
