<div style="width:200px;">

<p>Enter the fraction of the domain that the region you selected
covers. For example, for a lower right partial ternary diagram whose
bottom axis covers the range from 30% to 100% of the bottom right
component, enter 70% for the bottom side.

<p>If you wish to use different scales for the two axes, you may need
to enter the apparent axis length instead. For example, if the top
component in the diagram ranges from only 0-1%, but for legibility it
is takes up as much room in the displayed image as if it ranged from
0-10%, then enter 10% for the axis length. Later, you can rescale the
Y axis (<u>P</u>roperties/<u>S</u>cale/<u>Y</u> axis/top component) to
change the top Y value from 0.1 (10%) to the true value of 0.01 (1%).

<p>You may enter values as decimals, fractions, or percentages, but if
you use percentages, do not omit the percent sign.
